{"instruction": "Generate a news article for the following headline.", "input": "Rebuilding New Orleans, One Appeal at a Time", "output": "Every day the line snakes down a spartan corridor on the eighth floor of City Hall here, as hundreds of people clutch a piece of paper inscribed with a fateful percentage that could force them to abandon their home.\nThe number is always over 50, and it means a house was so damaged in the flooding after Hurricane Katrina -- more than half-ruined -- that it faces demolition, unless the owner can come up with tens of thousands of dollars to raise it several feet above the ground and any future floodwaters.\nBut there is a way out, and that is why so many people stand in line every day, collectively transforming this battered city.\n\"What you need to do is talk to a building inspector and get that lowered below 50 percent,\" a city worker calls out to the crowd.\nAnd at the end of the line, in a large open room down the hall, that is exactly what happens, nearly 90 percent of the time, New Orleans officials say.\nBy agreeing so often to these appeals -- more than 6,000 over the last few months -- city officials are in essence allowing random redevelopment to occur throughout the city, undermining a plan by Mayor C.

Ray Nagin to produce a blueprint for the city's recovery, issued a proposal on Wednesday to upgrade hurricane protection with measures beyond what the corps has called for.\nTo prevent storm surges from pushing into the city's drainage canals, the commission proposed a series of jetties to stand in front of the three canals, which it says could be built quickly and cheaply and provide New Orleans with some much-needed peace of mind.\n\"There is, very much, a tension between things that can be done quickly versus those that might take a little longer,\" Lawrence Roth, deputy executive director of the American Society of Civil Engineers, said in a telephone interview on Friday.\nHis group has weighed in with far-reaching recommendations, and other groups are preparing proposals of their own.\nThe mayor's commission also proposed a network of dams that would block or slow the opening between the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal and Lake Pontchartrain, and block storm surges from flowing up the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a navigation channel that has been blamed for a storm surge funnel effect that increased the damage to eastern New Orleans.\nThe group is also calling for long-term flood-control structures that would block or slow surges at the two passes between Lake Pontchartrain and the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe fast-track structures would cost $100 million to $170 million, according to the commission's estimates, a fraction of the $3.1 billion the federal government has proposed spending on flood control measures in the area.\nThe commission said its proposals would not interfere with any of the corps's plans, but would be add-ons that complement the current plans.\nThe proposals have not yet found broad support among other engineering experts who have been working on strengthening New Orleans's storm defenses, but Dan Hitchings, the director of the corps's Task Force Hope, which is coordinating the hurricane response in Louisiana and Mississippi, said the plans were welcome and would be examined.\nMr. Roth, of the Society of Civil Engineers, said there would always be competing ideas about how to improve flood protection.\nThe idea of jetties, he said, might be made moot by closing off the canals and putting in new pumping stations at the lake, as the corps has planned.\n\"Many different people can look at a problem and come up with many different solutions, all with tradeoffs,\" he said.\n\"Which would be better -- jetties or a pump station?\nYou might never get an answer to that.\"\nMeanwhile, the corps's work to restore flood protection to its pre-hurricane levels continues around the clock.\nThis month the corps solicited bids for building temporary closures and pumps at the mouths of the city's three drainage canals, and it is rebuilding long stretches of levee in St. Bernard Parish and along the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal.\nThe corps is looking to measures that will further strengthen the flood protection system, including restoring levees to their originally designed heights.\nThese measures can be in place by September 2007, according to the corps.\nBeyond that, the corps has embarked on a two-year, $8 million study to determine how to strengthen the hurricane protection system for New Orleans and southern Louisiana.\nA preliminary version of that report is due in June.\nWhile the Bush administration's top official on Gulf Coast reconstruction, Donald Powell, has said the government will build a system that is \"better and stronger\" than what was there before, the administration has not committed to what the people of New Orleans desperately want: protection from Category 5 storms, the toughest that nature can dish out.\nMr. Hitchings said that the corps was slightly behind schedule but that he expected things to move quickly.\n\"It's not linear,\" he said, because the \"gear-up time\" to get contractors in place and to make materials like the enormous quantities of soil available was so great.\nNow \"they're really moving out,\" he said.\nThe corps built 30 days of weather delays into the schedule, he said, and with a little help from favorable weather, \"I'm very optimistic that they will regain their schedule and in the end get it all finished with plenty of time.\"\nThe corps's long-term study, he said, would probably have a lot in common with the outside proposals that are beginning to flow in, but \"right now, we're focused on the very near term.\"\nThe engineering society is investigating the failure of the levees and is working with the groups that will monitor the corps's progress.\nIts recommendations include \"armoring\" the dry side of levees so they are not eroded away from underneath if water spills over the top.\nWithout armoring, Mr. Roth said, \"failure is catastrophic because it causes the wall to fail.\"\nThe corps has said that the armoring process, like other projects that would go beyond the restoration of the levees to pre-hurricane strength, will have to be approved by Congress.\n\"It's going to take people being willing to take a chance, to be bold, to sort out Louisiana's levee problems,\" said Ivor van Heerden, deputy director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center and a member of Team Louisiana, the group formed by the state to investigate the causes of the levee failures.\nHis group, too, will

winds of 110 miles an hour on Oct. 24, 2005, Mario Nievera, Palm Beach's leading landscape architect, was in Pennsylvania, putting on a brave face as he delivered a lecture about his work to the Philadelphia Garden Club.\nAs Mr. Nievera showed slides of his more exquisite creations -- purple bougainvillea wrapped around coconut palms and all\u00e9es of guava trees -- the plants themselves were being ripped to shreds by Wilma, which would ultimately cause $12.2 billion worth of property damage to Florida.\nHaving struggled for more than a year to revive gardens destroyed in September 2004 by Hurricane Frances -- the most destructive storm to hit the town since 1947 -- Mr. Nievera was daunted at having to start all over again.\nAlthough he stood to profit mightily, he dreaded the added stress.\nIn the wake of Wilma, he said in mid-January, \"there's twice as much work, on top of all our ongoing projects.\"\n\"And there are only so many hours in the day,\" he added, particularly in Palm Beach, where a job like his requires ceaseless socializing with fretful clients.\nAfter Frances and then, just three weeks later, Jeanne, \"nobody believed we'd get another hurricane\" Mr. Nievera said.\nMany of his clients rushed to restore their gardens to manicured perfection in late 2004 and in 2005, only to have them ripped out again by Wilma.\nMr. Nievera said most of his clients are growing more cautious about how they spend their garden budgets and asking for plants and trees that are more likely to survive another hurricane.\nThey appear to be heeding warnings from meteorologists that the area could face more major hurricanes in coming years.\nBefore Wilma \"the sky was the limit,\" he said, referring in particular to the sums spent on recreating his tropical but tailored designs after the 2004 hurricanes.\nA client who approached him for the first time after those storms commissioned a garden with $1 million worth of plants, which was installed just in time for Wilma's arrival.\n\"My client lost $500,000 worth of plants,\" Mr. Nievera said, adding, \"there's no such thing as hurricane insurance.\"\nWilma struck as Mr. Nievera was scurrying to get his clients' gardens ready for Thanksgiving, which some regard as the start of the winter season in Palm Beach.\nAs a result of the devastation, he is still working to finish several of the projects two months into the season -- a delay that few clients would have tolerated in years past.\nThe follies of the 2004-05 winter season have proven useful in one way, enabling Mr. Nievera to tailor his advice to clients based on his own observations of which plants can withstand extreme winds.\nWhen he advised Tom Quick, a Palm Beach resident whose fortune derives from Quick & Reilly, the former discount brokerage firm, to buy a pair of 30-foot date palms to replace a couple of coconut palms that had succumbed to Frances, it was for aesthetic reasons: they were large enough to hide a view of the house next door that had been opened up by Frances.\nBut the date palms, which cost roughly $10,000 apiece and cost $20,000 more to transport and install by crane, proved a practical investment.\n\"I can't complain: they survived Wilma,\" said Mr. Quick, surveying his backyard.\nA large clusia tree at the back of his house was less fortunate, and is now in dire shape.\n\"We're

plutocrats' playground with sustained winds of 110 miles an hour on Oct. 24, 2005, Mario Nievera, Palm Beach's leading landscape architect, was in Pennsylvania, putting on a brave face as he delivered a lecture about his work to the Philadelphia Garden Club.", "As Mr. Nievera showed slides of his more exquisite creations -- purple bougainvillea wrapped around coconut palms and all\u00e9es of guava trees -- the plants themselves were being ripped to shreds by Wilma, which would ultimately cause $12.2 billion worth of property damage to Florida.", "Having struggled for more than a year to revive gardens destroyed in September 2004 by Hurricane Frances -- the most destructive storm to hit the town since 1947 -- Mr. Nievera was daunted at having to start all over again.", "Although he stood to

in the day,\" he added, particularly in Palm Beach, where a job like his requires ceaseless socializing with fretful clients.", "After Frances and then, just three weeks later, Jeanne, \"nobody believed we'd get another hurricane\" Mr. Nievera said.", "Many of his clients rushed to restore their gardens to manicured perfection in late 2004 and in 2005, only to have them ripped out again by Wilma.", "Mr. Nievera said most of his clients are growing more cautious about how they spend their garden budgets and asking for plants and trees that are more likely to survive another hurricane.", "They appear to be heeding warnings from meteorologists that the area could face more major hurricanes in coming years.", "Before Wilma \"the sky was the limit,\" he said, referring in particular to the sums spent on recreating his tropical but tailored designs after the 2004 hurricanes.", "A client who approached him for the first time after those storms commissioned a garden with $1 million worth of plants, which was installed just in time for Wilma's arrival.", "\"My client lost $500,000 worth of plants,\" Mr. Nievera said, adding, \"there's no such thing as hurricane insurance.\"", "Wilma struck as Mr. Nievera was scurrying to get his clients' gardens ready for Thanksgiving, which some regard as the start of the winter season in Palm Beach.", "As a result of the devastation, he is still working to finish several of the projects two months into the season -- a delay that few clients would have tolerated in years past.", "The follies of the 2004-05 winter season have proven useful in one way, enabling Mr. Nievera to tailor his advice to clients based on his own observations of which plants can withstand extreme winds.", "When he advised Tom Quick, a Palm Beach resident whose fortune derives from Quick & Reilly, the former discount brokerage firm, to buy a pair of 30-foot date palms to replace a couple of coconut palms that had succumbed to Frances, it was for aesthetic reasons: they were large enough to hide a view of the house next door that had been opened up by Frances.", "But the date palms, which cost roughly $10,000 apiece and cost $20,000 more to transport and install by crane, proved a practical investment.", "\"I can't complain: they survived Wilma,\" said Mr. Quick, surveying his backyard.", "A large clusia tree at the back of his house was

{"instruction": "Generate a news article for the following headline.", "input": "Yearender-Economic Watch: Reasons to stay upbeat about the Chinese economy", "output": "China's economy has defied doom-mongers again in 2018, and economists believe there are good reasons to remain confident about its outlook.\nAlthough latest economic indicators revealed signs of stress, as industrial profits posted their first drop in three years and consumption growth missed expectations in November, merely focusing on short-term fluctuations will miss the big picture of the economy.\nChina's tone-setting economic meeting described problems facing the economy as part of development, noting that the country is still and will be in an important period of strategic opportunity for development for a long time to come.\nSOUND FUNDAMENTALS\nDespite downward pressure from the Sino-U.S. trade frictions, a rebalancing and deleveraging domestic economy and monetary tightening in certain developed economies, China has maintained stable economic growth, offering certainties to a world mired in uncertainties.\nIts GDP rose 6.7 percent in the first three quarters of 2018, putting the economy on track to meet the government's targeted growth of around 6.5 percent set for 2018.\nNiu Li, an economist with the State Information Center, a government think tank, said the economy is highly likely to rise 6.6 percent this year.\nThis means China remains a top performer in the global economic arena, with the IMF forecasting growth of 2.4 percent for advanced economies this year.\nThe Sino-U.S. trade frictions have been properly dealt with.\nEmployment remains stable, consumer inflation is kept at a mild level, resident income continues to grow steadily, while development is more balanced and sustainable with higher quality.\nConsumption is set to contribute 78.2 percent of China's economic growth this year, the highest level since 2001, according to a report released by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences this month.\n\"We expect consumption to remain the largest driver of the economy in the next decade,\" said Ding Shuang, an economist of the Standard Chartered Bank, citing great potential consumption to continue to grow faster than investment amid the ongoing trends of urbanization, aging and a rising middle-income group that demands quality goods and services.\nWhile consumer spending contributed a bigger share of GDP growth, technology and innovation are picking up the slack as certain traditional industries took a hit.\nHigh-tech manufacturing and equipment production sectors maintained fast expansion.\nIn the Global Innovation Index 2018 by the World Intellectual Property Organization, China became the first middle-income economy on the list of the world's 20 most innovative economies this year.\nThe medium-high level of growth achieved during the past year exhibited the vitality and resilience of the Chinese economy, which will ensure its future stability, said Liu Qiao, head of the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University.\nENOUGH AMMUNITION\nAnother reason for the optimism is that the Chinese policymakers have many economic levers at hand to deal with challenges, analysts said.\nThe government's options include supply-side structural reform, credit policy, and fiscal firepower.\nOn the monetary policy front, economists said broad-based easing is not immediately on the cards, but the central bank may tweak policies to keep funding flowing to the backbone of the economy without funneling credit to companies that are already highly indebted.\nThe Standard Chartered Bank said the People's Bank of China might cut the reserve requirement ratio by 200 basis points by the end of 2019 to prevent a tightening of monetary and credit conditions and reduce funding costs for the real economy by providing banks with long-term liquidity at a relatively low cost.\nChina's stable economic growth enables a more proactive fiscal policy through deeper tax and fee cuts as well as accelerating government spending.\nUBS economist Wang Tao expected the fiscal budget deficit to rise to 3 percent of GDP in 2019 from 2.6 percent in 2018, and tax cuts to exceed one percent of GDP, mainly in value-added tax, corporate income tax, and individual income tax, together with a reduction in corporate social insurance contribution.\nTo boost government spending, the country's legislature has adopted a decision to speed up local government bond issuance before the approval of the annual fiscal budget.\nBetween Jan.

ground in opening up and provided new platforms for win-win cooperation with the rest of the world.\nForeign ownership restrictions in the financial and auto sectors have been eased, with some ownership caps to be removed completely in the coming three years; tariffs were cut for an array of imported products including cars, consumer products, and industrial goods; and more import duty cuts will come into effect next year.\nReform and opening-up has gained pace.\nIn its latest step, China announced on Dec. 25 a negative list for market access that is shorter and applies to all market players, allowing them to equally enter sectors that are not on the list.\nThe government will continue to widen market access for foreign investors while the negative list is expected to be further shortened in 2019, said Tang Wenhong, head of foreign investment management department under the Ministry of Commerce.\nIn the coming year, the country also vowed to push forward with reforms in various fields including state-owned enterprises, taxation and financing, land, market access as well as social management.\nTo promote foreign trade, China will expand exports and imports and promote the diversification of export markets.\nIt will continue to advance the Belt and Road Initiative, actively participate in WTO reforms, and promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation,

{"instruction": "Generate a news article for the following headline.", "input": "In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of \u2018Jihad\u2019 Case", "output": "In 1997, as the government listened in on their phone call, Adham Hassoun, a computer programmer in Broward County, Fla., proposed a road trip to Jose Padilla, a low-wage worker there.\nThe excursion to Tampa would be his treat, Mr. Hassoun said, and a chance to meet \"some nice, uh, brothers.\"\nMr. Padilla, 36, a Brooklyn-born Puerto Rican who had converted to Islam a few years earlier, knew Mr. Hassoun, an outspoken Palestinian, from his mosque.\nStill, according to a transcript of the conversation obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Padilla equivocated as Mr. Hassoun exhorted.\n\"We take the whole family and have a blast,\" Mr. Hassoun said.\n\"We go to, uh, our Busch Gardens, you know You won't regret it.\nMoney-back guarantee.\"\nMr. Padilla, laughing, suggested that they not discuss the matter over the phone.\n\"Why?\"\nMr. Hassoun said.\n\"We're going to Busch Gardens.\nWhat's the big deal!\"\nThat conversation took place five years before Mr. Padilla, a United States citizen accused of plotting a \"dirty bomb\" attack against this country, was declared an enemy combatant.\nGiven that Mr. Padilla and Mr. Hassoun are now criminal defendants in a terrorism conspiracy case in Miami, it sounds suspicious, as if Mr. Hassoun were proposing something more sinister than a weekend at the amusement park.\nHe well may have been -- but maybe, too, he was sincere or joking about a Muslim retreat.\nDeciphering such chatter in order to construct a convincing narrative of conspiracy is a challenge.\nYet, prosecutors say, the government will rely largely on wiretapped conversations when it puts Mr. Padilla, Mr. Hassoun, and a third defendant, Kifah Jayyousi, on trial as a \"North American support cell\" that sent money, goods and recruits abroad to assist \"global jihad.\"\nTens of thousands of conversations were recorded.\nSome 230 phone calls form the core of the government's case, including 21 that make reference to Mr. Padilla, prosecutors said.\nBut Mr. Padilla's voice is heard on only seven calls.\nAnd on those seven, which The Times obtained from a participant in the case, Mr. Padilla does not discuss violent plots.\nBut this is not the version of Mr. Padilla -- Al Qaeda associate and would-be bomber -- that John Ashcroft, then the attorney general, unveiled in 2002 when he interrupted a trip to Moscow to trumpet Mr. Padilla's capture.\nIn the four and a half years since then, as the government tested the limits of its power to deal with terrorism outside the traditional law enforcement system, Mr. Padilla is the only accused terrorist to have gone from enemy combatant to criminal defendant.\nHis criminal trial, scheduled to begin late this month, will feature none of the initial claims about violent plotting with Al Qaeda that the government cited as justification for detaining Mr. Padilla without formal charges for three and a half years.\nThose claims came from the government's overseas interrogations of terrorism suspects, like Abu Zubaydah, which, the government said, Mr. Padilla corroborated, in part, during his own questioning in a military brig in South Carolina.\nBut, constrained by strict federal rules of evidence that would prohibit or limit the use of information obtained during such interrogations, the government will make a far more circumscribed case against Mr. Padilla in court, effectively demoting him from Al Qaeda's dirty bomber to foot soldier in a somewhat nebulous conspiracy.\nThe initial dirty bomb accusation did not disappear.\nIt quietly resurfaced in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\nThe government filed the dirty bomb charges against Mr. Padilla's supposed accomplice, an Ethiopian-born detainee, at about the same time it indicted Mr. Padilla on relatively lesser offenses in criminal court.\nA Change in Strategy\nThe change in Mr. Padilla's status, from enemy combatant to criminal defendant, was abrupt.\nIt came late in 2005 as the Supreme Court was weighing whether to take up the legality of his military detention and the Bush administration, by filing criminal charges, pre-empted its review.\nIn a way, Mr. Padilla's prosecution was a legal maneuver that kept the issue of his detention without charges out of the Supreme Court.\nAfter apprehending him at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago in May 2002, the Bush administration made a choice: to detain Mr. Padilla militarily, in order to thwart further plotting, rather than to follow him in order to gather evidence that might serve a criminal prosecution.\nNow that Mr. Padilla has ended up a criminal defendant after all, the prosecution's case does not fully reflect the Bush administration's view of who he is or what he did.\nSenior government officials have said publicly that Mr. Padilla provided self-incriminating information during interrogations, admitting, they said, to undergoing basic terrorist training, to accepting an assignment to blow up apartment buildings in the United States, and to attending a farewell dinner with Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, the suspected master planner of the Sept. 11 attacks, before he flew to Chicago in 2002.\nBut any confessions by Mr. Padilla while he was detained without charges and denied access to counsel -- whether or not he was mistreated, as his lawyers claim -- would not be admissible in court.\nAnd it is unlikely that information obtained during the harsh questioning of Al Qaeda detainees would be admissible, either -- and, further, the government is disinclined to expose sensitive intelligence or invite further scrutiny of secret jails overseas.\nProbably as a consequence, the current criminal case zeroes in on what the government sees as an earlier stage of Mr. Padilla's involvement with terrorism.\nIt focuses primarily on the other defendants' support during the 1990s for Muslim struggles overseas, especially in Bosnia, Kosovo and Chechnya.\nMr. Padilla, who was appended to their pre-existing case, in which he had been an unnamed co-conspirator, is depicted as their recruit.\nAlthough prosecutors have declined to discuss the government's strategy, their filings and statements in court provide a picture of the case they are expected to present at trial.\nThe most tangible allegation against Mr. Padilla is that in 2000 he filled out, under an alias, an Arab-language application to attend a terrorist training camp.\nThat application is expected to be offered into evidence alongside the wiretapped conversations, but Mr. Padilla's lawyers say they will contest its admissibility, challenging the government's assertion that the \"mujahideen data form\" belonged to their client.\nRobert Chesney, a specialist in national security law at Wake Forest University, called the prosecution a pragmatic one, analogous to \"going after Al Capone on tax evasion.\"\nBut Deborah Pearlstein, a lawyer with Human Rights First who has consulted with Mr. Padilla's defense, said that his will never be an ordinary, pragmatic prosecution.\n\"If Jose Padilla were from Day 1 just charged and tried, then maybe,\" she said.\n\"But this is a case that comes after three and a half years of the most gross deprivation of human rights that we've seen in this country for a long time.\"\nFurther, Ms. Pearlstein noted, the government has reserved the option, should the prosecution fail, of returning Mr. Padilla to the military brig.\nThis, she said, \"casts a shadow\" over the current prosecution.\nThe Bush administration's military case against Binyam Mohamed, 28, the Ethiopian detainee at Guant\u00e1namo, put the current proceedings in a different light, too.\nIn December 2005, Mr. Mohamed was referred to the military commission in Guant\u00e1namo on accusations that he conspired with Mr. Padilla on the dirty bomb plot.\nIt was little noticed at the time.\nBut accusations against Mr. Padilla that are nowhere to be found in the indictment against him filled the pages of Mr. Mohamed's charging sheet, with Mr. Padilla repeatedly identified by name.\nThe sheet referred to the two men meeting in Pakistan after Sept. 11, 2001, studying how to build an improvised dirty bomb, discussing the feasibility of a dirty bomb attack with Al Qaeda officials and agreeing to undertake the mission to blow up buildings.\nMr. Mohamed's lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, said that these charges were based on a forced confession by Mr. Mohamed, who, he said, was tortured overseas into admitting to a story that was fed to him.\n\"Binyam was told all along that his job was to be a witness against Padilla, Abu Zubaydah and Khaled Sheikh Mohammed,\" Mr. Stafford Smith said, adding that his client \"has no conscience knowledge that he ever met\" Mr. Padilla.\nThe charges against Mr. Mohamed and other Guant\u00e1namo detainees who were headed for prosecution there have been suspended temporarily as a result of the Military Commissions Act passed by Congress in October.\nThose charges are likely to be reinstated, a Pentagon official said yesterday.\nThat Mr. Mohamed faced dirty bomb charges and Mr. Padilla does not speaks to the central difference between being a terrorism suspect in Guant\u00e1namo and a criminal defendant charged with terrorism offenses in the United States.\nIn Guant\u00e1namo, the military commission system that deals with foreign-born terrorism suspects is expected to allow, with some exceptions, the use of information obtained through coercion.\n\"Federal court rules are restrictive,\" Professor Chesney of Wake Forest University School of Law said.\n\"The very essence of why they're trying to have that separate military system was to create rules to use information that is deemed by the intelligence community to be trustworthy but wouldn't make it under the federal rules of evidence.\"\nDavid Cole, a professor of law at Georgetown University and author of books on terrorism and civil liberties, sees the difference between the two systems more critically: \"What this says clearly is that they feel that they can get away with using tainted evidence in the military commission system that they can't use in the criminal court system.\"\nThe Wiretapping Case\nThe criminal case against Mr. Padilla has its roots in the prosecution of Sheikh Omer Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric who was convicted in 1995 of conspiring to blow up the United Nations and other New York landmarks.\nIn the early 1990s, Sheikh Rahman's telephone was tapped, and Mr. Hassoun and Dr. Jayyousi, a Jordanian-born American citizen who holds a doctorate in civil engineering, came to the government's attention through phone calls to or from his line.\nThen the government, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, began to eavesdrop on them, which eventually pulled Mr. Padilla into their net, too.\nThe government presents the three defendants as \"joined at the hip,\" as one prosecutor put it in a hearing last summer.\nBut Judge Marcia G. Cooke of Federal District Court, noting that Mr. Padilla was appended to a case well under way, asked the government, \"If they are so joined at the hip, why is Mr. Padilla so late to the dance?\"\nDr. Jayyousi, a former school system administrator in both Detroit and Washington, D.C., never met Mr. Padilla, his lawyer, William Swor, said.\nIt is Mr. Hassoun, the government said, who recruited Mr. Padilla.\nBut both Mr. Hassoun's and Mr. Padilla's lawyers deny that Mr. Padilla was recruited.\nSeven Taped Phone Calls\nMr. Padilla's lawyers and relatives say that he left South Florida for Egypt in September 1998 on a spiritual journey.\nA former juvenile offender, he converted to Islam as part of an effort to straighten out his life, they say.\nHis mosque in Fort Lauderdale sponsored his travel, he told friends, relatives and F.B.I.\nagents who interviewed him in 2002.\nMr. Hassoun belonged to that mosque, and the telephone transcripts seem to indicate that Mr. Hassoun helped, at the least, with Mr. Padilla's travel plans.\nThe seven taped phone calls that bear Mr. Padilla's voice involve conversations with Mr. Hassoun from 1997 to 2000.\nOn those calls, Mr. Padilla, unlike some of the other defendants, does not employ what the government says is coded language.\nAccording to the government, other defendants refer to their jihad-related plans as \"getting some fresh air,\" \"participating in tourism,\" \"opening up a market,\" \"playing football,\" and so on.\nThis leads to silly-sounding exchanges where \"the brothers\" discuss going on \"picnics\" in order \"to smell fresh air and to eat cheese\" or using $3,500 to buy \"zucchini.\"\nIn contrast, Mr. Padilla's seven conversations with Mr. Hassoun range from straightforward -- Mr. Hassoun tells Mr. Padilla that his grandmother has died; Mr. Padilla tells Mr. Hassoun that he has found himself an 18-year-old Egyptian bride who is willing to wear a veil -- to vaguely suggestive or just odd.\nIn one phone call, the two men talked about a dream.\nIt appeared to be the dream that Mr. Padilla, according to his relatives, cites as having played a crucial role in inspiring him to convert to Islam: the vision of a man in a turban, surrounded by the swirling dust of a desert.\nMr. Hassoun brought it up and told Mr. Padilla that he himself had experienced the same vision.\n\"What do you mean you saw the same dream?\"\nMr. Padilla asked.\n\"I saw the dream of the uh person with the turban,\" Mr. Hassoun said.\nMr. Hassoun explained how, in his dream, the turban was wrongly wrapped and so he thought the man might be a spy, in which case, he was prepared \"to split his body apart.\"\nBut then, he said, he understood that \"the brother was a good one.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\nMr. Padilla said.\nIn three of the seven conversations, Mr. Padilla made statements that the government has identified as \"overt acts\" in furtherance of the accused conspiracy.\nIn the first, Mr. Hassoun asked, \"You're ready, right?\"\nand Mr. Padilla said, \"God willing, brother, it's going to happen soon.\"\nThat was the summer of 1997, a year before Mr. Padilla left South Florida for Egypt.\nIn the second, Mr. Padilla told Mr. Hassoun, during a 1999 conversation from Egypt, that he had asked his ex-wife in the United States to arrange for him to receive an army jacket, a book bag and a sleeping bag, supplies that he had requested because \"there was a rumor here that the door was open somewhere.\"\nIn the third, Mr. Padilla told Mr. Hassoun in April 2000, that he would need a recommendation to \"connect me with the good brothers, with the right faith\" if he were to travel to Yemen.\nProsecutors say Mr. Padilla is mentioned, although by his Muslim name Ibrahim or by another alias, on 21 additional tapes.\nOne of them refers to Ibrahim as being \"in the area of Usama,\" which the government takes to mean that he was near Osama bin Laden.\nBut Mr. Padilla's lawyers contest that interpretation.\n\"That is just nonsensical, Your Honor, that these men who for years, according to the government, have been talking in code all of a sudden are going to throw Osama bin Laden's name around,\" Michael Caruso, a federal public defender, said in court.\nMr. Padilla has pleaded not guilty.\nBut before his case goes before a jury, his fitness to stand trial will be evaluated.\nOn the basis of Mr. Padilla's lawyers' assertion that he is mentally damaged as a result of his prolonged isolation and his interrogation in the brig, Judge Cooke has ordered a psychiatric evaluation by a Bureau of Prisons doctor to be completed this week.\nCorrection: January 5, 2007, Friday A front-page article yesterday about wiretapped conversations in the case against Jose Padilla, who is accused of plotting a \"dirty bomb\" attack, omitted two lines at the continuation in some copies.\nThe sentence should have read: \"In the four and a half years since then, as the government tested the

there.", "The excursion to Tampa would be his treat, Mr. Hassoun said, and a chance to meet \"some nice, uh, brothers.\"", "Mr. Padilla, 36, a Brooklyn-born Puerto Rican who had converted to Islam a few years earlier, knew Mr. Hassoun, an outspoken Palestinian, from his mosque.", "Still, according to a transcript of the conversation obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Padilla equivocated as Mr. Hassoun exhorted.", "\"We take the whole family and have a blast,\" Mr. Hassoun said.", "\"We go to, uh, our Busch Gardens, you know You won't regret it.", "Money-back guarantee.\"", "Mr. Padilla, laughing, suggested that they not discuss the matter over the phone.", "\"Why?\"", "Mr. Hassoun said.", "\"We're going to Busch Gardens.", "What's the big deal!\"", "That conversation took place five years before Mr. Padilla, a United States citizen accused of plotting a \"dirty bomb\" attack against this country, was declared an enemy combatant.", "Given that Mr. Padilla and Mr. Hassoun are now criminal defendants in a terrorism conspiracy case in Miami, it sounds suspicious, as if Mr. Hassoun were proposing something more sinister than a weekend at the amusement park.", "He well may have been -- but maybe, too, he was sincere or joking about a Muslim retreat.", "Deciphering such chatter in order to construct a convincing narrative of conspiracy is a challenge.", "Yet, prosecutors say, the government will rely largely on wiretapped conversations when it puts Mr. Padilla, Mr. Hassoun, and a third defendant, Kifah Jayyousi, on trial as a \"North American support cell\" that sent money, goods and recruits abroad to assist \"global jihad.\"", "Tens of thousands of conversations were recorded.", "Some 230 phone calls form the core of the government's case, including 21 that make reference to Mr. Padilla, prosecutors said.", "But Mr. Padilla's voice is heard on only seven calls.", "And on those seven, which The Times obtained from a participant in the case, Mr. Padilla does not discuss violent plots.", "But this is not the version of Mr. Padilla -- Al Qaeda associate and would-be bomber -- that John Ashcroft, then the attorney general, unveiled in 2002 when he interrupted a trip to Moscow to trumpet Mr. Padilla's capture.", "In the four and a half years since then, as the government tested the limits of its power to deal with terrorism outside the traditional law enforcement system, Mr. Padilla is the only accused terrorist to have gone from enemy combatant to criminal defendant.", "His criminal trial, scheduled to begin late this month, will feature none of the initial claims about violent plotting with Al Qaeda that the government cited as justification for detaining Mr. Padilla without formal charges for three and a half years.", "Those claims came from the government's overseas interrogations of terrorism suspects, like Abu Zubaydah, which, the government said, Mr. Padilla corroborated, in part, during his own questioning in a military brig in South Carolina.", "But, constrained by strict federal rules of evidence that would prohibit or limit the use of information obtained during such interrogations, the government will make a far more circumscribed case against Mr. Padilla in court, effectively demoting him from Al Qaeda's dirty bomber to foot soldier in a somewhat nebulous conspiracy.", "The initial dirty bomb accusation did not disappear.", "It quietly resurfaced in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.", "The government filed the dirty bomb charges against Mr. Padilla's supposed accomplice, an Ethiopian-born detainee, at about the same time it indicted Mr. Padilla on relatively lesser offenses in criminal court.", "A Change in Strategy", "The change in Mr. Padilla's status, from enemy combatant to criminal defendant, was abrupt.", "It came late in 2005 as the Supreme Court was weighing whether to take up the legality of his military detention and the Bush administration, by filing criminal charges, pre-empted its review.", "In a way, Mr. Padilla's prosecution was a legal maneuver that kept the issue of his detention without charges out of the Supreme Court.", "After apprehending him at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago in May 2002, the Bush administration made a choice: to detain Mr. Padilla militarily, in order to thwart further plotting, rather than to follow him in order to gather evidence that might serve a criminal prosecution.", "Now that Mr. Padilla has ended up a criminal defendant after all, the prosecution's case does not fully reflect the Bush administration's view of who he is or what he did.", "Senior government officials have said publicly that Mr. Padilla provided self-incriminating information during interrogations, admitting, they said, to undergoing basic terrorist training, to accepting an assignment to blow up apartment buildings in the United States, and to attending a farewell dinner with Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, the suspected master planner of the Sept. 11 attacks, before he flew to Chicago in 2002.", "But any confessions by Mr. Padilla while he was detained without charges and denied access to counsel -- whether or not he was mistreated, as his lawyers claim -- would not be admissible in court.", "And it is unlikely that information obtained during the harsh questioning of Al Qaeda detainees would be admissible, either -- and, further, the government is disinclined to expose sensitive intelligence or invite further scrutiny of secret jails overseas.", "Probably as a consequence, the current criminal case zeroes in on what the government sees as an earlier stage of Mr. Padilla's involvement with terrorism.", "It focuses primarily on the other defendants' support during the 1990s for Muslim struggles overseas, especially in Bosnia, Kosovo and Chechnya.", "Mr. Padilla, who was appended to their pre-existing case, in which he had been an unnamed co-conspirator, is depicted as their recruit.", "Although prosecutors have declined to discuss the government's strategy, their filings and statements in court provide a picture of the case they are expected to present at trial.", "The most tangible allegation against Mr. Padilla is that in 2000 he filled out, under an alias, an Arab-language application to attend a terrorist training camp.", "That application is expected to be offered into evidence alongside the wiretapped conversations, but Mr. Padilla's lawyers say they will contest its admissibility, challenging the government's assertion that the \"mujahideen data form\" belonged to their client.", "Robert Chesney, a specialist in national security law at Wake Forest University, called the prosecution a pragmatic one, analogous to \"going after Al Capone on tax evasion.\"", "But Deborah Pearlstein, a lawyer with Human Rights First who has consulted with Mr. Padilla's defense, said that his will never be an ordinary, pragmatic prosecution.", "\"If Jose Padilla were from Day 1 just charged and tried, then maybe,\" she said.", "\"But this is a case that comes after three and a half years of the most gross deprivation of human rights that we've seen in this country for a long time.\"", "Further, Ms. Pearlstein noted, the government has reserved the option, should the prosecution fail, of returning Mr. Padilla to the military brig.", "This, she said, \"casts a shadow\" over the current prosecution.", "The Bush administration's military case against Binyam Mohamed, 28, the Ethiopian detainee at Guant\u00e1namo, put the current proceedings in a different light, too.", "In December 2005, Mr. Mohamed was referred to the military commission in Guant\u00e1namo on accusations that he conspired with Mr. Padilla on the dirty bomb plot.", "It was little noticed at the time.", "But accusations against Mr. Padilla that are nowhere to be found in the indictment against him filled the pages of Mr. Mohamed's charging sheet, with Mr. Padilla repeatedly identified by name.", "The sheet referred to the two men meeting in Pakistan after Sept. 11, 2001, studying how to build an improvised dirty bomb, discussing the feasibility of a dirty bomb attack with Al Qaeda officials and agreeing to undertake the mission to blow up buildings.", "Mr. Mohamed's lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, said that these charges were based on a forced confession by Mr. Mohamed, who, he said, was tortured overseas into admitting to a story that was fed to him.", "\"Binyam was told all along that his job was to be a witness against Padilla, Abu Zubaydah and Khaled Sheikh Mohammed,\" Mr. Stafford Smith said, adding that his client \"has no conscience knowledge that he ever met\" Mr. Padilla.", "The charges against Mr. Mohamed and other Guant\u00e1namo detainees who were headed for prosecution there have been suspended temporarily as a result of the Military Commissions Act passed by Congress in October.", "Those charges are likely to be reinstated, a Pentagon official said yesterday.", "That Mr. Mohamed faced dirty bomb charges and Mr. Padilla does not speaks to the central difference between being a terrorism suspect in Guant\u00e1namo and a criminal defendant charged with terrorism offenses in the United States.", "In Guant\u00e1namo, the military commission system that deals with foreign-born terrorism suspects is expected to allow, with some exceptions, the use of information obtained through coercion.", "\"Federal court rules are restrictive,\" Professor Chesney of Wake Forest University School of Law said.", "\"The very essence of why they're trying to have that separate military system was to create rules to use information that is deemed by the intelligence community to be trustworthy but wouldn't make it under the federal rules of evidence.\"", "David Cole, a professor of law at Georgetown University and author of books on terrorism and civil liberties, sees the difference between the two systems more critically: \"What this says clearly is that they feel that they can get away with using tainted evidence in the military commission system that they can't use in the criminal court system.\"", "The Wiretapping Case", "The criminal case against Mr. Padilla has its roots in the prosecution of Sheikh Omer Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric who was convicted in 1995 of conspiring to blow up the United Nations and other New York landmarks.", "In the early 1990s, Sheikh Rahman's telephone was tapped, and Mr. Hassoun and Dr. Jayyousi, a Jordanian-born American citizen who holds a doctorate in civil engineering, came to the government's attention through phone calls to or from his line.", "Then the government, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, began to eavesdrop on them, which eventually pulled Mr. Padilla into their net, too.", "The government presents the three defendants as \"joined at the hip,\" as one prosecutor put it in a hearing last summer.", "But Judge Marcia G. Cooke of Federal District Court, noting that Mr. Padilla was appended to a case well under way, asked the government, \"If they are so joined at the hip, why is Mr. Padilla so late to the dance?\"", "Dr. Jayyousi, a former school system administrator in both Detroit and Washington, D.C., never met Mr. Padilla, his lawyer, William Swor, said.", "It is Mr. Hassoun, the government said, who recruited Mr. Padilla.", "But both Mr. Hassoun's and Mr. Padilla's lawyers deny that Mr. Padilla was recruited.", "Seven Taped Phone Calls", "Mr. Padilla's lawyers and relatives say that he left South Florida for Egypt in September 1998 on a spiritual journey.", "A former juvenile offender, he converted to Islam as part of an effort to straighten out his life, they say.", "His mosque in Fort Lauderdale sponsored his travel, he told friends, relatives and F.B.I.", "agents who interviewed him in 2002.", "Mr. Hassoun belonged to that mosque, and the telephone transcripts seem to indicate that Mr. Hassoun helped, at the least, with Mr. Padilla's travel plans.", "The seven taped phone calls that bear Mr. Padilla's voice involve conversations with Mr. Hassoun from 1997 to 2000.", "On those calls, Mr. Padilla, unlike some of the other defendants, does not employ what the government says is coded language.", "According to the government, other defendants refer to their jihad-related plans as \"getting some fresh air,\" \"participating in tourism,\" \"opening up a market,\" \"playing football,\" and so on.", "This leads to silly-sounding exchanges where \"the brothers\" discuss going on \"picnics\" in order \"to smell fresh air and to eat cheese\" or using $3,500 to buy \"zucchini.\"", "In contrast, Mr. Padilla's seven conversations with Mr. Hassoun range from straightforward -- Mr. Hassoun tells Mr. Padilla that his grandmother has died;

And the average gain for equities during these years has been 18 percent.\nAs has been the case throughout this decade, the equity markets caught a much-needed second wind in the fourth quarter, which drove the Dow Jones industrial average and the Russell 2000 index of small stocks to record levels late last year.\nAccording to Morningstar, the average domestic stock fund surged 6.9 percent in the quarter, marking the sixth consecutive year-end rally for stocks.\nWhat propelled stock prices higher this time?\nFor starters, data released late in the year \"put to rest all the extraneous worries about the economy,\" said James Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management in Boston.\nIn the spring, concerns that the Federal Reserve may have done too good of a job of slowing the economy threatened to tame the bull market.\nIn fact, a growing number of economists began to worry about the possibility of a recession on the horizon.\nAs a result, stocks ran into a proverbial wall of worry in the spring and early summer.\nFrom May 5 to June 13, the S.& P. 500 slumped 7.7 percent, its worst slide since the bear market earlier this decade.\nFor the entire second quarter, the average domestic stock fund lost 2.8 percent.\nBut as it turned out, the economy -- and consumers, for that matter -- proved stronger than expected.\nMoreover, oil prices stabilized and the Fed all but said that it was done raising short-term interest rates for now.\n\"Once investors were no longer worried about recession, they were willing to jump back on the risk train,\" said Thomas W. McDowell, chief executive and chief investment officer at Rice Hall James, an investment management firm in San Diego.\nHe's not kidding.\nIn the fourth quarter, investors, whom many analysts thought would embrace relatively conservative assets like blue-chip domestic stocks, went back to their speculative ways.\nAND they were rewarded handsomely for their risk taking.\nWithin the fixed-income world, for example, the average emerging-market bond fund rose 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter and 11.1 percent for the year.\nHigh-yield bond funds did nearly as well, posting quarterly gains of 4.2 percent and annual returns of 10.3 percent.\nBy comparison, the average bond fund that invests in long-term debt issued by the United States government rose just 0.1 percent in the quarter and 0.6 percent for the year.\nThe picture was much the same in the equity markets.\nThe average diversified emerging-market stock fund, for example, soared 17.4 percent in the quarter and finished the year up 32.6 percent, according to Morningstar.\nThe best-performing fund category was Latin American stock portfolios, which posted gains of 21.5 percent for the quarter and 45.2 percent for 2006.\nOn the domestic front, many of the same sectors that have been leading the markets in recent years dominated again in 2006.\nPrecious-metals funds, for instance, rallied 32.2 percent for the year and are now up 33.7 percent, annualized, over the last five years.\nReal estate and utilities portfolios also soared, posting average gains last year of 34 percent and 25.5 percent, respectively.\nAnd thanks in part to the recent wave of mergers and acquisitions, financial sector funds rose 16.4 percent, on average.\nDespite predictions that this would be the year when large-cap domestic stock funds returned to dominance, small-cap stock funds again led the domestic markets among general domestic stock funds.\nAccording to Morningstar, the average small-cap growth fund advanced 11.1 percent last year, versus 7.3 percent for the average large-cap growth portfolio.\nAnd while large-cap value funds outperformed their small-cap counterparts for the full year, they trailed small-cap value funds in the fourth quarter.\n\"This appetite for risk has me a little worried,\" Mr. Swanson said.\nHe asserted that investors aren't simply expecting a so-called soft landing in the economy -- in other words, the avoidance of a recession.\n\"The market is bracing for the plane to circle and take off again -- and I think that's too optimistic,\" he said.\nAnother reason that speculative investments are doing so well is that despite 17 interest-rate increases since June 2004, ample liquidity continues to slosh around the global financial markets.\n\"Right now, there's still too much money chasing too few financial assets,\" said Stuart A. Schweitzer, global markets strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset and Wealth Management.\nJames W.

Confesses After Capture,\" shouted The Daily News.\nTaking note of Mr. Caruso's Sicilian heritage and lack of formal education, the articles variously described the defendant as \"dull-eyed and expressionless,\" an \"ignorant father\" given to speaking \"broken English,\" and \"a raging giant whose black eyes were afire with hate and revenge.\"\nDeliberations, and Death Row\nThe trial, before Judge Alonzo McLaughlin in Kings County Court, then at Joralemon Street and Boerum Place in Downtown Brooklyn, had moments of high drama.\nJury selection, which began April 4, proved to be a complicated affair and took two days.\nWhen a brief postponement was granted, the doctor's distraught widow, Helen, stood up in the gallery and shouted: \"This man murdered my husband, and it was a cruel, cold murder!\nHe should be killed.\nInstead, he gets an adjournment.\"\nOnce the testimony got under way, the defendant's own words were chilling.\n\"I said he had killed my boy and I was going to kill him,\" Mr. Caruso said of the doctor.\n\"Soon he didn't breathe anymore, and I ran to the kitchen, got a carving knife and stabbed him in the throat.\nMy wife stood in the doorway and saw it all.\"\nUltimately, the jury rejected the defense's argument that Mr. Caruso was suffering from temporary insanity and concluded that his actions had been deliberate and premeditated.\nOn April 7, Mr. Caruso was convicted of first-degree murder, which carried an automatic death sentence.\nAs the judge congratulated the Caruso jurors, noting that \"any other finding would have been a miscarriage of justice,\" the defendant was packed off to death row at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining.\nStar-Studded Counsel\nThen the tide turned.\nA campaign to spare Mr. Caruso's life picked up momentum among Italian-American friendship societies.\nAn ambitious New York congressman named Fiorello La Guardia visited the Caruso family.\nA defense committee was organized by a press agent named Alexander Marky, and thanks to him, Mr. Caruso's wife and daughter were able to make appeals for mercy over the radio.\nThe defense committee recruited renowned lawyers to its cause, including Walter Pollak, who would later help defend the young African-Americans sentenced to death in the notorious Scottsboro Boys case.\nThe committee's most prominent member was Clarence Darrow, the legendary defender of evolution in the Scopes \"monkey trial,\" who came out of retirement to help draft Mr. Caruso's appeal.\nOn Nov. 22, alleging 14 trial errors and citing more than 100 other cases, this star-studded legal team persuaded the Court of Appeals to void Mr. Caruso's conviction for first-degree murder and order a new trial.\nThe court's chief judge was Benjamin Cardozo, who would go on to join the United States Supreme Court.\nAt the Caruso home, the defendant's family celebrated the good news with a fat Thanksgiving turkey.\nAt the Pendola home, the doctor's widow rocked her baby daughter, Catherine, and wept.\n\"We have nothing to be thankful for,\" she told reporters.\n\"My baby and I are alone.\nAnd the man who killed my husband, my baby's father, is alive and may go free.\"\nMr. Caruso's new trial began two months later, and this time around, matters took some curious turns.\nA jury was impaneled in a brisk two hours; the very next day, Jan. 31, 1928, Judge McLaughlin, who had presided at the first trial and sentenced Mr. Caruso to death a scant nine months earlier, halted the proceedings to allow Mr. Caruso to plead guilty to first-degree manslaughter.\nThe prosecutor, on record as saying Mr. Caruso should face the first-degree murder charge again in the second trial, also did a turnabout, agreeing to the manslaughter plea.\nThe judge then sentenced the defendant to serve a maximum of 20 years.\nIn the end, Mr. Caruso served only six years.\nReturning to his family, he fathered another son, Dom, and lived the rest of his life in relative obscurity, working as a laborer, a house painter and a caretaker.\nHe died in 1968, at age 77.\nAfter the Anguish\nFor decades, Dom Caruso had a troubled relationship with his father, who, in the son's eyes, despised him because he could never replace his beloved brother.\nAs Dom remembered it, his mother once told him that his father had tried to have the midwife write the name \"Joey\" on his birth certificate when he was born, but the mother had vehemently rejected the idea.\nOne morning in 1952, when Dom was 16, his father sat him down at the breakfast table of their Jericho, Long Island, home and, already drunk on red wine, as was his custom, began to tell an extraordinary story.\nAccording to Dom, his father said that Dr. Pendola was not the first man he had murdered.\nThe father, a strapping man of 230 pounds, said that he was a longtime \"made man\" in the Sicilian Mafia, and that, through beatings, knifings and shootings, he had served as an enforcer for Salvatore D'Aquila, an Al Capone associate and the capo di tutti capi of the New York Mafia.\nSo, Dom Caruso recounted, when Cheech Caruso found himself facing the electric chair, he was not abandoned.\nAl Capone and Salvatore D'Aquila helped to set up a defense fund, hire top-flight lawyers to work on Mr. Caruso's appeal, and orchestrate the abrupt denouement of the second murder trial by pressuring Gov.\nAlfred E. Smith or one of his top lieutenants.\nThe governor, who would run for president that year, enjoyed huge support from Italian-Americans.\nThe father's tale is almost impossible to substantiate.\nOn the one hand, Dom Caruso has no physical evidence of the father's statements about the Mafia and the trial.\nMoreover, Dom's own family has been at least partly skeptical of the tale; for example, his siblings hotly disputed Dom's claim, based on his talk with his father, that their brother Sal had been named after Salvatore D'Aquila.\nAs for the involvement of Smith's administration, the best evidence is very unspecific.\nThomas Reppetto, author of \"American Mafia: A History of Its Rise to Power,\" said that the governor was undeniably under the sway of powerful party bosses, particularly those in Tammany Hall, who would not have hesitated to seek a favor from the Mafia.\nBut, Mr. Reppetto also said, he knew of no proof that Al Smith had ever done favors for the Mafia.\nOn the other hand, there are some facts that lend weight to the father's story.\nOn the day after Mr. Caruso's arraignment, for instance, The New York Times noted that in 1918 Francesco Caruso had been arrested by the police and fined $100 for carrying a concealed pistol, not a fix encountered by a regular laborer.\nThen there are the turnabouts of the judge and prosecutor at the second trial, and the question of how the costly appeals effort on Mr. Caruso's behalf was financed, even if it was a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.\nWhatever the truth may be, it is difficult to know exactly what relatives of the victim may have felt about this claim or about the case in general.\nAttempts to reach direct descendants of Dr. Pendola -- through death, Social Security and newspaper records and through St. John's Cemetery -- were unsuccessful.\nAmong relatives who could be located and did agree to speak was Michael Criss, whose great-grandfather Pietro Pendola was Dr. Pendola's cousin.\nMr. Criss, who teaches at Oklahoma State University and is the unofficial historian of the Pendola family in the United States, said he had first heard about the murder from cousins who were small children when it occurred.\n\"I think what Caruso did was heinous,\" Mr. Criss said, \"even if you take into consideration his emotional state.\nHowever, I see no reason to blame his family and descendants for his actions.\"\nWhen one of those descendants, Dom Caruso, visits St. John's Cemetery, the first member of his family ever to do so, he will find two graves about a 10-minute walk from each other.\nThey are remarkable for their unremarkableness.\nJoey's final resting place is an unmarked charity grave, which was paid for by the Roman Catholic Church's Society of St. Vincent de Paul.\nDr. Pendola is buried in a marble family vault shaded by pine trees.\nThere is the surname Pendola, but there is no visible monument bearing birth or death dates, and no first name.\nThere are no words of solace or affection, no religious symbols or biblical inscriptions, no mention of the fact that the deceased was a husband, a father and a practitioner of the healing arts.\nFor Dom Caruso, whose profound sadness over what happened that wintry night in 1927 extends to the Pendola family as well as his own, the primary concern remains how the outcome of the case must have affected the doctor's widow and daughter, even though he was never able to ascertain their fate.\n\"I doubt that poor Helen found any peace in her lifetime,\" Mr. Caruso said of the doctor's widow, who, according to Mr. Criss, died three decades ago.\n\"I hope and pray that Catherine did.\nI'd like to believe that.\"", "output_sentences": ["ONE day this winter, on a pilgrimage that will be either blessedly cathartic or

believe that prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who disappeared four days ago after entering Saudi Arabia\u2019s consulate in Istanbul, was killed inside the consulate, two Turkish sources said on Saturday.\n\u201cThe initial assessment of the Turkish police is that Mr Khashoggi has been killed at the consulate of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul.\nWe believe that the murder was premeditated and the body was subsequently moved out of the consulate,\u201d one of the two Turkish officials told Reuters.\nThe Turkish sources did not say how they believed the killing was carried out.\nA Saudi source at the consulate denied that Khashoggi had been killed at the mission and said in a statement that the accusations were baseless.\nThe Saudi source said that a security team including Saudi investigators had arrived in Istanbul on Saturday to take part in the investigation into Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s consul-general told Reuters earlier on Saturday that his country was helping search for Khashoggi, and dismissed talk of his possible abduction.\nKhashoggi, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Washington for the past year fearing retribution for his criticism of Saudi policies, entered the consulate on Tuesday to secure documents for his forthcoming marriage, according to his fiancee, who waited outside.\nHe has not been heard of since.\nSince then, Turkish and Saudi officials have offered conflicting accounts of his disappearance, with Ankara saying there was no evidence that he had left the diplomatic mission and Riyadh saying he exited the premises the same day.\nThe United States is seeking more information, a State Department official said.\n\u201cWe are not in a position to confirm these reports, but we are following them closely,\u201d the official said.\nA Turkish security source told Reuters that a group of 15 Saudi nationals, including some officials, had arrived in Istanbul in two planes and entered the consulate on the same day Khashoggi was there, and later left the country.\nThe Turkish source said Turkish officials were trying to identify them.\nTurkey\u2019s Anadolu news agency also reported that the group of Saudis were briefly at the consulate.\nDEEPENING DIVISIONS\nKhashoggi\u2019s disappearance is likely to further deepen divisions between Turkey and Saudi Arabia.\nRelations were already strained after Turkey sent troops to the Gulf state of Qatar last year in a show of support after its Gulf neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, imposed an embargo on Doha.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said this week that the kingdom would allow Turkey to search the consulate for Khashoggi.\nBut he also criticized Turkey\u2019s crackdown following a 2016 failed coup against Erdogan.\nOn Saturday, Yasin Aktay, Erdogan\u2019s AK Party adviser and a friend of Khashoggi, told Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera: \u201cWe demand a convincing clarification from Saudi Arabia, and what the crown prince offered is not convincing.\u201d\nHe also said what happened to Khashoggi was a crime and those responsible for his disappearance must be tried, Al Jazeera said.\nTurkish prosecutors have begun an investigation into the case, officials said on Saturday, and a spokesman for Erdogan\u2019s AK Party said authorities would uncover his whereabouts.\n\u201cThe condition of

Gonzalez, chairman and chief executive of Kimberly-Clark's Mexico operations and the director who had headed the compensation committee when the company changed its performance goals midstream.\nMany shareholders also favored a proposal urging the Home Depot board to allow its investors to vote on an advisory basis to approve the company's compensation; 40 percent voted for the measure.\nShareholders also supported a measure that would have required the board to accept resignations from directors who failed to receive support from a majority of votes cast.\nAfter the meeting, Home Depot said it would require such a vote from shareholders for the election of its directors.\nEven so, the company continued to tinker last year with its pay practices in a way that may have been intended to generate pay for Mr. Nardelli in periods of poor performance at the company.\nLast November, a Home Depot spokesman disclosed that the company's huge stock buybacks, which have the effect of increasing earnings when measured per share, would be included in the calculation of long-term incentive targets.\nIn previous years, the effects of the buybacks were excluded from the calculations.\nJohn A. Hill, the chairman of Putnam Funds, was one investor whose organization voted against Home Depot management at last year's meeting.\nHe said he was optimistic that Mr. Nardelli's resignation signaled a new responsiveness among corporate directors.\nBut he is uncertain.\n\"I think if a lot more shareholders withhold their votes for this board in the upcoming proxy season over their agreement with Nardelli, then it will really start to have an impact,\" Mr. Hill said.\n\"But as long as it is a minority, it won't.\"\nMr. Hill personally experienced Mr. Nardelli's disdain toward his shareholders.\nAs chairman of Putnam Funds, he wrote a letter after the annual meeting to Mr. Nardelli explaining why he had not earned the funds' support at the election.\nHe did not get a reply until August, when a reporter asked Home Depot why the chief executive had not responded to one of its large shareholders.\n\"He had become a lightning rod with the stock down,\" Mr. Hill said.\n\"But his not replying to our letter showed an arrogance there that came in on him.\"\nIt seems that \"my way or the highway\" -- Mr. Nardelli's message to Home Depot's beleaguered shareholders in recent years -- does not play that well anymore.", "output_sentences": ["Arrogance has never been attractive in a leader.", "Now, in corporate chief executives anyhow, it may be a career ender.", "The surprising defenestration yesterday of Robert L.

people were hurt, this was not our intention.\"\nThe Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, with whom Mr. Olmert met last week, condemned the raid, saying in a statement that it \"proved that

destruction of all efforts aimed at realizing peace,\" Mr. Abbas said.\nMr. Olmert and Mr. Mubarak said Egypt was continuing its efforts to secure the release of an Israeli corporal captured in June

which is blocking more substantive discussions with Mr. Abbas.\nEgyptian officials said that they were discussing another Olmert-Abbas meeting with Egyptian and Jordanian leaders present.\nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice is to visit the region this month.\nIt was an unusual and emotional day for Mr. Olmert, during which he commemorated two legendary Israeli political figures, both of whom he succeeded in their jobs.\nEarlier, in Jerusalem, he spoke at the state funeral for the city's fabled former mayor, Teddy Kollek, who died Tuesday at 95 and was buried in the area of the Mount Herzl cemetery reserved for Israel's leaders.\nMr. Olmert defeated Mr. Kollek to become Jerusalem's mayor in a bitter political fight in 1993.\nHe said Israel's first leader, David Ben-Gurion, had declared Jerusalem to be Israel's capital in 1949, but \"Teddy Kollek made it so.\"\nThursday also marked a year since Prime Minister Ariel Sharon suffered a second extensive stroke, which left him in a deep coma from which he is not expected to awaken.\nMr. Olmert, Mr. Sharon's deputy, was chosen to lead the Kadima Party in his stead and became prime minister, and he acknowledged Mr. Sharon's tragedy at his news conference in Egypt.\nIn general, Mr. Olmert has been regarded as inferior to Mr. Sharon and Mr. Kollek.\nIn the latest opinion poll, conducted by the Dahaf Institute and reported Thursday in the newspaper Yediot Aharanot, nearly 70 percent of Israelis polled said they disapproved of Mr. Olmert's performance as prime minister.\nIsraelis are unhappy with the way he managed the summer's war against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and do not much like his personality, contrasting him with the more stolid and experienced Mr. Sharon.\nStill, Mr. Olmert has proved himself a skilled politician, and early on Thursday Parliament quietly passed his $68 billion budget, a crucial test of his government's ability to survive.\nThe budget battle was always a great drama under Mr. Sharon, but Mr. Olmert, who has expanded his governing coalition to include parties ranging from Labor to the right-wing Israel Beiteinu Party of Avigdor Lieberman, had little difficulty.\nMr. Olmert's office is being rocked, though, by a new corruption scandal.\nHe has not been touched by this scandal, though he has been under investigation for smaller cases of improper use of influence.\nBut his longtime office director, Shula Zaken, has been put under house arrest and ordered not to contact Mr. Olmert as the police investigate whether she and the director of the Tax Authority, Jackie Matza, tried to help Ms. Zaken's brother and two other businesspeople through the appointment of cronies to key jobs in return for tax breaks.\nAbout 30 people are under some form of detention in the spreading scandal.\nThe operation in Ramallah by Israeli forces, with armored vehicles, bulldozers and helicopter support, was carried out hours before Mr. Olmert met with Mr. Mubarak.\nPalestinians and news reports said the operation was to arrest Rabiah Hamad of Fatah, a senior member of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades.\nThe army would not confirm that Mr. Hamad was the target, but said the man it wanted was armed and was wounded, but escaped.\nThe army arrested four other wanted Palestinians, a spokesman said.\nIt was a rare incursion into the heart of Ramallah, and it prompted an angry response.\nYouths on rooftops threw stones, metal trash barrels, a refrigerator and blocks of concrete at the Israeli Army vehicles.\nThere were mortars fired at the Israeli soldiers, and an exchange of gunfire.\nPalestinian medics said four men -- Yussef Abdel Khader, 23; Khalil al-Badawi, 20; Jamal Jawela, 29; and Ala al-Himran, in his 20s -- died at a Ramallah hospital from gunshot wounds.\nIn Gaza there was continuing violence, with three more men killed in fighting between Fatah and Hamas.\nThe fighting centered around the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza after gunmen surrounded the houses of known political or security figures.\nIn Beit Lahiya, a senior Fatah commander, Col. Muhammad Gharib, was killed and his wife severely wounded when Hamas militants attacked his home with rifle fire and rocket-propelled grenades.\nTwo of his bodyguards were also killed.\nAbout 25 others were wounded in Jabaliya, and local radio was filled with appeals to the gunmen to restore calm.\nOn Wednesday five Palestinians, including a woman who was a passer-by, were killed and 12 wounded in Fatah-Hamas gun battles, which broke a weeklong lull.\nOther militant factions arranged a truce overnight and kidnapped members of Hamas and Fatah were released by the other sides, but the truce broke down on Thursday.\nThe Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya, returned to Gaza on Thursday from hajj, his pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia.\nHis entourage underwent a special inspection in El Arish, Egypt, to ensure that he was not carrying large amounts of cash back to Gaza, which has been deprived of most Western aid since Hamas won parliamentary elections last January.\n[Early Friday, Mr. Haniya said he and Mr. Abbas had agreed at emergency talks to keep gunmen from their parties off Gaza's streets.]\nFor the fourth day there was no word about a kidnapped Peruvian photographer for Agence France-Presse, Jaime R\u00e1zuri, 50, who is said by colleagues to be lacking a required heart medication.\nPalestinian security services have warned foreign journalists to keep out of Gaza for now, because of the kidnappings and chaos.\nA leader of the Palestinian People's Party, Bassam al-Salhi, said the security chaos could be resolved only with political agreement.\n\"The weakness of the Palestinian political system and the situation of the current Hamas-led government have contributed to this state of lawlessness,\" he said.",
