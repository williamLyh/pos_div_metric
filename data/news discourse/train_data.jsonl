a 'federal tariff tax' on receipts, so people can understand that they are ultimately paying for the price of trade wars,\" Glenn Anderson, who runs the Tennessee Medical Cannabis Trade Association, said at a recent gathering here.\nThe gathering, held at the Tennessee Brew Works last Thursday, was aimed at voicing concerns and raising awareness over recent tariff measures from Washington.\nDuring the event, speakers as well as members of the audience shared personal experiences, observations, and at times satire regarding how the tariffs negatively impacted their lives.\nOne speaker on the podium was 38-year-old farmer Brandon Whitt, who manages a 200-year-old farm, Batey Farms, not far from Nashville.\nWhitt, an eighth-generation farmer, said the abrupt imposition of tariffs this year made him fear that he might have to give up his farm.\nBatey Farms produces a variety of crops, such as soybeans, corn and wheat, and raises a large number of pigs.\nA large part of the farm's produce ends up in overseas markets.\nBut due to the trade frictions the United States has initiated with other countries, overseas demand for U.S. agricultural products has tanked, driving down the prices for soybeans and pork, among others.\n\"I'm making 50 bushels an acre of soybeans, but that's 50 bushels per acre at a two-dollar decrease,\" Whitt said.\n\"I've done absolutely nothing wrong and lost 100 dollars an acre in profit.\"\n\"I'd like to carry our administration with me when I go to cash my grain checks and watch me deposit those checks and then immediately turn around and drive across town to my lender, whom I have to pay off except I'm missing 20, 30, 40 percent of that money to be able to pay off that operating loan,\" Whitt lamented.\nAside from damages, the uncertainties that come with the tariffs are also making farmers very uncomfortable.\n\"Nobody has a crystal ball.\nI don't think our officials in Washington have a crystal ball at all at this point right now.\nI think we're just kind of flying by the seat of our pants,\" Whitt said, in an apparent jab at the U.S. government.\nThe situation is almost like before the 2008 recession, Whitt said, adding that now people are just as discouraged to invest and hire as they were 10 years ago.\nWhitt said that as a farmer, he shouldn't be diverting his energy to learn about foreign policy or trade, but the status quo has left him with no choice.\n\"I don't like politics, but I have to get into politics,\" Whitt said, adding that Washington's ever-changing positions

last Thursday, was aimed at voicing concerns and raising awareness over recent tariff measures from Washington.", "During the event, speakers as well as members of the audience shared personal experiences, observations, and at times satire regarding how the tariffs negatively impacted their lives.", "One speaker on the podium was 38-year-old farmer Brandon Whitt, who manages a 200-year-old farm, Batey Farms, not far from Nashville.", "Whitt, an eighth-generation farmer, said the abrupt imposition of tariffs this year made him fear that he might have to give up his farm.", "Batey Farms produces a variety of crops, such as soybeans, corn and wheat, and raises a large number of pigs.", "A large part of the farm's produce ends up in overseas markets.", "But due to the trade frictions the United States has initiated with other countries, overseas demand for U.S. agricultural products has tanked, driving down the prices for soybeans and pork, among others.", "\"I'm making 50 bushels an acre of soybeans, but that's 50 bushels per acre at a two-dollar decrease,\" Whitt said.", "\"I've done absolutely nothing wrong and lost 100 dollars an acre in profit.\"", "\"I'd like to carry our administration with me when I go to cash my grain checks and watch me deposit those checks and then immediately turn around and drive across town to my lender, whom I have to pay off except I'm missing 20, 30, 40 percent of that money to be able to pay off that operating loan,\" Whitt lamented.", "Aside from damages, the uncertainties that come with the tariffs are also making farmers very uncomfortable.", "\"Nobody has a crystal ball.", "I don't think our officials in Washington have a crystal ball at all at this point right now.", "I think we're just kind of flying by the seat of our pants,\" Whitt said, in an apparent jab at the U.S. government.", "The situation is almost like before the 2008 recession, Whitt said, adding that now people are just as discouraged to invest and hire as they were 10 years ago.", "Whitt said that as a farmer, he shouldn't be diverting his energy to learn about foreign policy or trade, but the status quo has left him with no choice.", "\"I don't like politics, but I have to get into politics,\" Whitt said, adding that Washington's ever-changing positions and frequent threats have made the situation more challenging.", "Whitt also rejected the

factory location in paragraph 12)\nIn a town where a 30-feet tall chair is the chief landmark, and which is synonymous with a U.S. furniture industry decimated over the years by imports from China, many greet the possibility of tariffs on Chinese goods with a shrug.\nNo wonder.\nOf three once bustling Thomasville furniture plants in the city limits, one is being demolished and cleared for parkland, another may become the site of a new police station, and a third is being converted into apartments.\nPresident Donald Trump is threatening to levy tariffs of up to 25 percent on $500 billion of goods imported from China each year, including roughly $20 billion of furniture, as a way to bring back hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs lost to China and other low-cost competitors.\nYet, the transformation of U.S. industries since China\u2019s emergence as the world\u2019s low-cost producer almost two decades ago means many no longer directly compete with Chinese imports, so tariffs may not translate so easily into more U.S. jobs.\nAt family-owned Bernhardt Furniture in Lenoir, some 90 miles west of Thomasville, executives say it would take about $30 million in capital investment - some 10 percent of annual sales - to resurrect standard wood furniture lines now mainly made in countries like China and Vietnam.\nThat is too much to commit based on a policy that a future administration could reverse.\n\u201cThe theory is you turn (imports) off, the jobs come back.\nThat\u2019s not really true...\nThe buildings don\u2019t exist.\nThe people don\u2019t exist.\nThe machinery does not exist,\u201d to make the sorts of furniture that now gets imported, said Alex Bernhardt Jr., chief executive and the company founder\u2019s great grandson.\nWhat the company needs now, executives say, is the open markets and steady economy that have allowed it to grow its workforce from below 800 at the end of the 2007-2009 recession to almost 1,500 today - partly on the basis of exports to China.\nDIFFERENT COMPANY\nThat growth has been largely driven by demand for more customized, higher end furniture.\nIn expanding, the 129-year-old company has been hiring not only factory workers, but also designers, marketing experts and other professionals.\nIn all, it is a different firm from what it was three decades ago when it first began dividing product lines between the United States and Asia.\nThe sewing lines at Bernhard Furniture Company which where skilled craft jobs are growing without the help of tariffs, and company officials say they are pressed to fill open positions is shown in Lenoir, North Carolina, U.S., August 15, 2018.\nEconomists say the same is true across much of U.S. manufacturing.\nTo invest and hire more workers, executives would need certainty, for example, that consumers would prefer U.S.-made products at a potentially higher price.\nThey would need confidence that tariffs would last beyond the Trump administration and that production could not be shifted to other more cost-competitive countries.\nEven then, there may be little incentive to go back to old product lines for industries that have changed dramatically because of globalization.\nAcross the Rust Belt and the former factory towns of the south, the transformation is apparent.\nIn Buffalo, an old steel mill is now a solar panel factory, and a retail goods manufacturer now houses an office and restaurant park.\nNear Dayton, Ohio, a shuttered GM plant has reopened as a Chinese-owned auto glass company.\nAbandoned factories throughout North Carolina have landed on the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s list of \u201cbrownfield\u201d sites that need cleanup.\nSome companies are considering moving production from China as a result of the tariffs, but the jobs are unlikely to head home.\nIllinois-based CCTY Bearing, for example, said it planned to move U.S.-bound production from Zhenjiang, China, to a new plant near Mumbai in India to

Steel and Century Aluminum have said they will add at least several hundred jobs as a result of the higher prices they can charge.\nMid-Continental Nail, however, laid off 130 workers because of those higher steel prices, and furniture parts maker Leggett & Platt (LEG.N) has warned that rising metal prices would prompt it to shift production abroad.\nSo far, Washington has imposed duties on $250 billion of Chinese imports and Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on all Chinese goods.\nMany economists project new tariffs would on balance either slow down hiring or cause job losses in a manufacturing sector where employment has grown by 10 percent over the past eight years without special protection.\nThe furniture industry, among the hardest hit by Chinese imports, has added 43,000 jobs since its employment hit a low of 350,000 in 2011, helped by the recovering housing market and strong consumer demand.\nIndustry officials say skilled upholsterers and other workers are hard to find, echoing the Federal Reserve\u2019s concern about the impact of worker shortages on the U.S. economy.\nIn Thomasville, few expect that tariffs will bring furniture manufacturing back to its heyday, nor does the community need it, says city manager Kelly Craver, whose parents worked in the furniture and textile industries.\nSince the recession, Thomasville has become a residential hub for

lower cost from the Alcantara base on its north coast.\n\u201cThe microsatellite market is most attractive today and we are interested in the 50 to 500-kilo niche,\u201d Aguiar told Reuters at the base\u2019s main launch pad.\n\u201cWe are developing a rocket for microsatellites.\nFor that this tower is totally ready.\u201d\nSpace cooperation between the United States and Brazil took a big step forward when they signed a Space Situational Awareness (SSA) agreement last month during a visit to Brasilia by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis.\nThe accord on sharing real-time tracking data on objects and debris in space is needed to develop a satellite launching business without the risk of collision.\nBoeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) in December visited the Alcantara space center, which is especially attractive to smaller firms, such as Tucson, Arizona-based rocket-maker Vector Launch Inc, because its equatorial location cuts fuel costs by a third allowing heavier payloads.\nBut Brazil\u2019s plan to become a new hub in the space industry will depend on concluding a technology safeguard agreement (TSA) with the United States to protect sensitive American space launch and satellite technology, Aguiar said.\nWithout it, no U.S. rocket can blast off from the South American country.\nA previous attempt at a U.S.-Brazilian space partnership was scuttled in 2003 when the TSA ran into resistance from the leftist government of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and was thwarted by Brazilian lawmakers.\nAguiar said that agreement floundered because it allowed the U.S. unverified access to the Alcantara base that was not acceptable on sovereignty grounds.\nA new Brazilian proposal under consideration by the U.S. government will be more \u201cpalatable\u201d to the Brazilian Congress.\nThe TSA is seen by Washington as opening opportunities for greater cooperation in aerospace and defense between the two countries.\nThe market for small satellite launches is expected to grow fast in the next few years and the U.S. space industry is keen to see new launch capacity in the world and a quick resolution to the negotiation of the TSA with Brazil.\n\u201cDemand for launch services has outstripped supply globally and another launch site is needed.\nBecause of its location, Alcantara offers advantages no other site in the world provides,\u201d an industry source said.\nAguiar said the government will set up a company called Alada to market the launch site.\nHe said the Air Force has been in talks with Brazilian aerospace company Embraer SA on how to manage the business going forward.\nOne possibility, Brazilian Air Force officials said, is a joint venture with Embraer\u2019s satellite company Visiona, which is not

"output": "The U.S. administration's tariffs on Chinese products, which expanded to an additional 200 billion U.S. dollars' worth of goods in September, are forcing businesses to rethink their supply chains.\nBut given China's comparative advantages as well as cost and market rules, it would not be easy to shift the supply chains away from China, U.S. trade experts have told Xinhua.\nCHINA: ONLY SOURCE OF IMPORTS FOR MANY PRODUCTS\n\"Tariffs are taxes that raise costs for businesses and consumers.\nFamilies will see higher prices for countless products.\nFor retailers, tariffs are very disruptive to complex global supply chains,\" U.S. National Retail Federation (NRF) spokeswoman Bethany Aronhalt told Xinhua.\n\"Right now, retailers are assessing their supply chains to determine possible alternative sources, but for certain products, China is the only source that exists,\" she said.\nThe NRF is the world's largest retail trade association representing discount and department stores, grocers, wholesalers, chain restaurants and Internet retailers from the United States and more than 45 countries and regions.\nThe group, the spokeswoman said, holds that \"tariffs and the retaliatory actions that follow are a threat to just about every sector of the U.S. economy, including manufacturing, agriculture, technology, retail, energy and more.\"\nAdjusting supply chains is \"not that simple in a global economy.\nBusinesses make production or sourcing decisions months and years in advance, and they rely on very complex supply chains,\" she said.\n\"Retailers and other importers could not easily or quickly switch to domestic sources because they do not exist on the scale that would be needed,\" she said.\n\"Even if there were to be an eventual switch to U.S. sourcing, it would take years to build up a base to support it.\nAnd for many products subject to tariffs, China is the sole source of U.S. imports.\nNo alternative sources exist,\" she said.\nWHAT ARE CHINA'S ADVANTAGES?\nAs the new wave of tariffs which came on top of the 50 billion dollars' worth already taxed earlier this year begins to make China look more expensive, few other places around the world could match China's advantages -- its highly skilled labor and the reliability of the supply chains.\nBefore the tariffs, some labor-intensive manufacturers have already started leaving China as the country's wages have risen for the past 10 to 15 years in a row, Mary Lovely, an American professor of economics and an expert on trade with China, told Xinhua in an interview.\nThey have already seen apparel, footwear, toys, sporting goods and some electronics moving elsewhere in Asia.\n\"These are things that we would expect because as China develops, the rest of East Asia or the poorer countries of East Asia also expect to be pulled along with that train,\" said Lovely, who is a professor of economics at Syracuse University and a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\"China is an engine of growth for the region, so none of that is surprising,\" she said.\n\"The tariffs will likely accelerate that,\" she said, adding that firms that are thinking about moving will probably go ahead because these additional 25 percent tariffs will make it very tough for them to compete with subcontractors in other countries that won't face these tariffs.\n\"And that puts competitive pressure on China so it will accelerate changes in global value chains,\" she said.\nBut not all firms can do that, she said.\nFor one thing, companies produce or purchase higher value items from China, which are made by more highly skilled labor and are reflecting relationships that have developed, she said.\n\"Many of those supply chains are certified by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in the United States or other regulatory bodies and moving them is difficult,\" she said.\n\"So there's a great deal of uncertainty and firms are really in doubt as to what they should do because moving the supply chain is costly.\nBefore you want to do that, you want to make sure that it's something that you really need to do,\" she said.\nShe warned that \"the uncertainty causes a kind of paralysis on investment and we are already seeing some slowdown in investment flows.\"\nAccording to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis released in July, net foreign direct investment dropped to 51.3 billion dollars in the first quarter, a 37 percent fall from the same quarter in 2017 and a 65 percent decline from the first quarter of 2016.\nUNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR U.S.\nThe Texas-based arts and crafts retail chain, Michaels, has warned in early September that retail prices could be hit by the U.S. administration's new round of tariffs on Chinese imports.\nAn estimated 400 million dollars of its product costs would be subject to the new round of tariffs, Chief Executive Officer Chuck Rubin told a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. retail conference in New York on Sept. 5.\nBut the cost of goods to fill its shelves is not what annoys the largest American arts and crafts retail chain most as Michaels has \"a lot of levers\" it can pull to mitigate the impact, Rubin said.\nWhile the company with a large bulk of its goods coming from China is looking into shifting manufacturing to other countries, he said, \"There is virtually no possibility of moving manufacturing into the U.S.\"\nCompanies that are forced to rethink their sourcing may find their hands tied as \"supply chains are built by companies with great care and substantial analysis,\" said Professor Robert Sicina, executive in residence of Kogod School of Business at the Washington-based American University.\n\"To disrupt them is to negatively impact the confidence firms have in the U.S. having a consistent policy,\" Sicina told Xinhua in an interview.\n\"Without consistency, firms will move their supply chains away from the U.S., not towards it.\nThis is just one example of the unintended consequences of President (Donald) Trump's actions,\" said Sicina, who has 30 years of experience in senior executive positions at big banks and various entrepreneurial endeavors.\n\"The supply chain is always going to move to where the economics are best,\" he said, adding that \"the economics are overwhelmingly in favor of China.\"\nAnother major, long-term unintended consequence, Sicina said, is that \"foreign investment in the U.S. will also be disrupted because of the tariffs.\"\nWhen investment flows into the United States, foreign investors have to consider its trade policies, as extra tariffs will impact investors' ability to import raw materials and export their products, Sicina said.\n\"Trump's trade war is to curb foreign investment in the future, because they're going to lack confidence that the U.S. will play by the rules, because it's now breaking the rules of fair trade in expectation of cutting a better deal with China,\" he said.", "output_sentences": ["The U.S. administration's tariffs on Chinese products, which expanded to an additional 200 billion U.S. dollars' worth of goods in September, are forcing

Dutchman Paul Polman, the chief executive, agreed to scrap the plan during a call early on Friday after it became clear that it could fall short of the approval needed, a source familiar with the matter said.\nUnilever had decided to collapse its Anglo-Dutch structure following a review sparked by last year\u2019s failed $143 billion takeover approach by Kraft-Heinz (KHC.O).\nThe stated aim was to make it more efficient and agile in a consumer market rocked by e-commerce, social media and upstart rivals.\nBut at least 10 shareholders, which collectively own around 12 percent of Unilever PLC, had publicly opposed the move.\nThey were worried about the effective forced selling of their shares with no premium, uncertainty around the future tax treatment of Dutch dividends and a perception that the move was partly aimed at securing greater takeover protection under Dutch law.\nUnilever\u2019s U-turn comes at a sensitive time for the British government, which is battling to protect jobs and investment as Prime Minister Theresa May fights for her proposed divorce plan from the European Union.\n\u201cThe UK is one of the best places in the world to grow a business, and our modern Industrial Strategy commits us to being an open and competitive economy and a great place to locate global headquarters,\u201d Business Secretary Greg Clark said.\nEven with a single corporate entity domiciled in the Netherlands, Unilever was keeping two of its three business units in Britain, allowing it to maintain its UK staff of 7,300.\nIn the Netherlands, the decision has triggered political fallout for Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte over his unpopular proposal to scrap a withholding tax on dividends that was seen as helping to woo Unilever.\nRelated Coverage Abandoned by Unilever, Dutch prime minister forced to reconsider tax plan\nHe said on Friday the government was reconsidering the plan.\nDeputy Finance Minister Menno Snel said the Dutch cabinet was meeting to discuss the consequences.\n\u201cWe would have liked to have seen this turn out differently,\u201d he told reporters.\nHARD SELL\nUnilever\u2019s exit from the FTSE would have forced funds mandated to track the index to sell their shares.\nThat may have pressured the price for the remaining shareholders, some of whom worried that shares in the new Unilever would be less liquid.\nThe plan\u2019s highest hurdle was that it needed backing of a majority of UK shareholders, holding at least 75 percent of the shares.\nThose two conditions meant that small shareholders, often overlooked, could have swung the vote.\nAs such, a number of independent investors holding their shares in nominee accounts had contacted their administrators in recent days to make adjustments needed to vote themselves, according to two trading platforms.\nThe Investor Forum, which works to escalate investor\nconcerns to companies, said it worked with over 20 institutions on this issue.\n\u201cThis demonstrates the value of asset managers actively engaging with their investee companies,\u201d said Rupert Krefting, head of corporate governance and stewardship, at M&G Investments, which opposed the proposal.\nUnilever took the unusual step of putting a full-page advert in the British press to try to sell the idea to skeptical investors, and executives gave a round of interviews last week to make their point.\nBut on Friday Unilever recognized that the proposal had not received support from a significant group of shareholders.\n\u201cThe board will now consider its next steps and will continue to engage with our shareholders,\u201d Dekkers said, adding Unilever will proceed with the plan to cancel its Dutch preference shares.\nEarlier this week, influential proxy advisory firm PIRC recommended shareholders vote against the move.\nAnother service, IVIS - the corporate governance research service of the Investment Association - issued a \u201cred top\u201d recommendation on the move on Friday, its strongest level of concern.\nSources said Unilever saw the writing on the wall.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always common for a vote to be pulled when it\u2019s going to lose,\u201d said Tim Bush, head of governance and financial analysis at PIRC.\nWHAT NEXT\nUnilever\u2019s Anglo-Dutch structure dates back to 1929 when British soap maker Lever Brothers combined with Dutch margarine company Margarine Unie.\nUnilever sold its margarine and spreads business earlier this year to KKR (KKR.N).\nThe company\u2019s board on Friday said it still believes that simplifying its dual-headed structure is the best choice for the long term.\nFor now, investors are likely to focus on the company\u2019s operational performance.\nIt will report third-quarter results on 18

strong cooperation to Malaysia\u2019s efforts to recoup 1MDB funds, and bring prosecutions.\nA proposal to monetize assets acquired using 1MDB funds that U.S. authorities are looking to seize under its anti-kleptocracy program was an option under consideration, Lim said.\nThe DOJ is seeking to seize $1.7 billion in assets allegedly bought with funds stolen from 1MDB, including a Picasso painting, shares in a Hollywood production company, a yacht and nearly $200 million in jeweler.\nLast month, Malaysian police said that cash worth 114 million ringgit ($28.6 million), jewelry and over 400 luxury handbags were seized from several apartments linked to Najib, as part of their probe into 1MDB.\nLim said his ministry is also investigating several \u201chighly suspicious\u201d deals made by Najib\u2019s administration to determine if they were carried out to help pay for 1MDB dues.\nHe declined to identify the deals, but said Malaysia was investigating state-run palm oil agency

Khazanah Nasional, were used to pay 1MDB\u2019s liabilities in 2017.\nLim said the government will have to pay an estimated 50 billion ringgit in debts and interest accumulated by 1MDB.\n\u201cWe are

probe into the murder 12 years ago of a Mongolian model could spell more trouble for former Malaysian premier Najib Razak, as the new government pressed ahead with investigations into alleged corruption.\nOn Saturday, Mongolia\u2019s president requested Malaysia\u2019s new leaders to find justice for the dead woman, Altantuya Shaariibu, while a fugitive policeman convicted of the crime said he would cooperate with any new probe if he was given a full pardon.\nPrime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has already barred Najib from leaving Malaysia after surprisingly defeating his one-time protege in an election on May 9.\nThe new government is seeking answers to how billions of dollars disappeared from a state fund that Najib founded, and its anti-graft agency has asked the ex-premier, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing, to make a statement at its headquarters on Tuesday.\nIn the case of the murdered Mongolian model, two policemen from Najib\u2019s security detail were convicted, and have death sentences hanging over them, but the question of who ordered them to kill 28-year-old Altantuya has never been answered.\nWhile released on bail during an appeal one of those officers fled to Australia.\nSpeaking from an immigration detention centre, where he has been held since 2015 for overstaying his visa, Sirul Azhar Umar told news portal Malaysiakini that he would help any move by the government to resurrect the case so long as he walked free.\n\u201cHence, I am willing to assist the new government to tell what actually transpired provided that the government grants me full pardon,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\nNajib, who was deputy prime minister and defence minister at the time of the murder, has denied knowing Altantuya or playing any role in her death, but the mystery has haunted his political career.\nCalls by Reuters to Najib\u2019s spokesman for comment on the latest developments went unanswered.\nHis relative and one-time close associate, Abdul Razak Baginda, a defence consultant and political analyst who was said to have been the dead woman\u2019s lover, had been charged with abetting the murder but was acquitted in 2008.\nMongolian President Battulga Khaltmaa\u2019s call for justice was made in a congratulatory message to the 92-year-old Mahathir.\n\u201cAs president of Mongolia, I pay special attention to the aggravated crime, that on October 18, 2006, a citizen of Mongolia and mother of two children, Shaariibuu Altantuya, was murdered in Malaysia,\u201d he said in the letter to Mahathir that was also posted on his office\u2019s website.\nANWAR ADVOCATES NEW CHARGES\nMahathir, asked on Monday whether he would consider commuting Sirul\u2019s death sentence, said: \u201cWe cannot do everything at the same time at one go.\u201d (Full Story)\nAnwar Ibrahim, the rival who allied with Mahathir to topple Najib, said judges\u2019 reluctance to call key witnesses in the murder case had \u201cmade a mockery of the law\u201d.\n\u201cThe best way is to proffer a new charge and allow for a full hearing of the case,\u201d Anwar told The Australian newspaper following his own release from prison earlier this week

Jong Un agreed in June to help return the remains of American troops killed in the 1950-53 Korean War, it was seen as one of the more attainable goals to come out of his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump.\nAmerican officials expect North Korea to hand over around 50 sets of remains in coming days or weeks, but the drawn-out process of negotiations to get to this point highlights the complications involved in the issue.\nAt the heart of the difficulty, former officials involved in previous recovery missions say, are likely demands from North Korea for cash compensation, as well as the unsolved tensions over North\u2019s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile arsenal.\nMore than 7,700 U.S. troops who fought in the Korean War remain unaccounted for, with about 5,300 of those lost in what is now North Korea, according to the Defence POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA), the U.S. military agency tasked with tracking down prisoners of war and troops missing in action.\nThe Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the United States and North Korea still technically at war.\nSoon after the June summit, Trump announced North Korea had returned the remains of 200 soldiers that had already been found, but this has yet to take place and negotiations over the actual handing over of the remains have dragged on.\nTrump told an audience of veterans on Tuesday that he hoped \u201cfallen warriors\u201d would begin to come home \u201cvery soon.\u201d\nBill Richardson, a former U.S. diplomat with experience negotiating with North Korea, including during the recovery of the remains of seven Americans in 2007, said Pyongyang was using the issue as \u201ca bargaining chip\u201d.\n\u201cThey\u2019re stalling,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\u201cI think in the end the North Koreans will turn over the majority of the remains that they have - but it will have a price.\nNot just a financial price.\u201d\nREMAINS RETURNED\nBetween the 1990s and 2005, more than 400 caskets of remains found in North Korea were returned to the United States, and the bodies of some 330 Americans were accounted for, according to the DPAA.\nDecades-old remains that North Korea has handed over in the past have not always been identifiable as U.S. troops.\nThe U.S. and North Korea worked together on so-called joint field activities (JFAs) to recover remains from 1996-2005, until Washington halted operations, expressing concerns about the safety of its personnel.\nA Congressional Research Service (CRS) report said the United States paid $28 million to North Korea for assistance in the effort.\n\u201cTo the best of my knowledge, it was never based on a per body calculation.\nPayments were made in support of each field mission \u2013 each joint recovery operation,\u201d said Frank Jannuzi, a former Democratic Senate Foreign Relations Committee staffer focusing on East Asian and Pacific affairs.\nPayments were to compensate North Korea for direct expenses incurred such as fuel costs, disruption of agricultural planting, or equipment costs, he said.\nIn 2011, President Barack Obama\u2019s administration agreed with Pyongyang to restart recovery missions, offering to pay $5,669,160 in \u201ccompensation\u201d for services provided by North Korea.\nThose planned missions never happened, however, as Washington called off the deal after North Korea tested a rocket in early 2012, said Paul Cole, author of \u201cPOW/MIA Accounting.\u201d\n\u201cIf the past is any indicator, the (North Koreans) are demanding up-front deliveries of food, fuel and at least $5 million in cash,\u201d Cole told Reuters.\n\u201cIn the era of \u2018maximum pressure,\u2019 the dilemma for the Trump administration is whether to give the (North Koreans) massive amounts of food, fuel, trucks, SUVs and millions in cash, or cancel the deal.\u201d\nFormer officials say typically North Korea has not asked for compensation when it unilaterally returns remains it recovers, such as the roughly 200 currently being discussed.\nBut if the United States hopes to send its own teams into North Korea, there will likely be a cost.\nAsked whether the cost of future joint field activities would be similar to what was paid in the past, the Pentagon\u2019s DPAA Public Affairs Office said: \u201cAs of yet, there are no JFAs scheduled in North Korea so we cannot speculate on what such activities may cost.\u201d\nThe U.S. State Department did not have an immediate comment on the negotiations, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week North Korea had committed to return the first remains \u201cin the next couple of weeks.\u201d [nL1N1UE1A3]\nAccording to CRS, the United States also paid for recovery operations in Vietnam.\nAs with North Korea,

drawn-out process of negotiations to get to this point highlights the complications involved in the issue.", "At the heart of the difficulty, former officials involved in previous recovery missions say, are likely demands from North Korea for cash compensation, as well as the unsolved tensions over North\u2019s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile arsenal.", "More than 7,700 U.S. troops who fought in the Korean War remain unaccounted for, with about 5,300 of those lost in what is now North Korea, according to the Defence POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA), the U.S. military agency tasked

330 Americans were accounted for, according to the DPAA.", "Decades-old remains that North Korea has handed over in the past have not always been identifiable as U.S. troops.", "The U.S. and North Korea worked together on so-called joint field activities (JFAs) to recover remains from 1996-2005, until Washington halted operations, expressing concerns about the safety of its personnel.", "A

officials say typically North Korea has not asked for compensation when it unilaterally returns remains it recovers, such as the roughly 200 currently being discussed.", "But if the United States hopes to send its own teams into North Korea, there will likely be a cost.", "Asked whether the cost of future joint field activities would be similar to what was paid in the past, the Pentagon\u2019s

varies a lot in election years as it depends on how many of their stations serve battleground states where campaigns spend heavily in a particular year for reasons such as close polls.\nAlso, strong demand for political commercials tends to eat into core advertising revenue from clients like carmakers as broadcasters only have a finite number of timeslots, said Leo Kulp, analyst at RBC Capital

guilty to only two out of seven charges.\nThe deal will not release Manafort from prison, but calls for an up to ten-year cap on Manafort's jail time though it may not include any likely sentence for

Kennedy of Massachusetts introduced legislation to require Mr. Bush to gain Congressional approval before sending more troops to Iraq.\nThe Senate vote is expected as early as next week, after an initial round of committee hearings on the plan Mr. Bush will lay out for the nation Wednesday night in a televised address delivered from the White House library, a setting chosen because it will provide a fresh backdrop for a presidential message.\nThe office of Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House, followed with an announcement that the House would also take up a resolution in opposition to a troop increase.\nHouse Democrats were scheduled to meet Wednesday morning to consider whether to interrupt their carefully choreographed 100-hour, two-week-long rollout of their domestic agenda this month to address the Iraq war.\nIn both chambers, Democrats made clear that the resolutions -- which would do nothing in practical terms to block Mr. Bush's intention to increase the United States military presence in Iraq -- would be the minimum steps they would pursue.\nThey did not rule out eventually considering more muscular responses, like seeking to cap the number of troops being deployed to Iraq or limiting financing for the war -- steps that could provoke a Constitutional and political showdown over the president's power to wage war.\nThe resolutions would represent the most significant reconsideration of Congressional support for the war since it began, and mark the first big clash between the White House and Congress since the November election, which put the Senate and House under the control of the Democrats.\nThe decision to pursue a confrontation with the White House was a turning point for Democrats, who have struggled with how to take on Mr. Bush's war policy without being perceived as undermining the military or risking criticism as defeatists.\n\"If you really want to change the situation on the ground, demonstrate to the president he's on his own,\" said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n\"That will spark real change.\"\nThe administration continued Tuesday to press its case with members of Congress from both parties.\nBy the time Mr. Bush delivers his speech, 148 lawmakers will have come to the White House in the past week to discuss the war, White House aides said Tuesday night, adding that most met with the president himself.\nWhile Mr. Kennedy and a relatively small number of other Democrats were pushing for immediate, concrete steps to challenge Mr. Bush through legislation, Democratic leaders said that for now they favored the less-divisive approach of simply asking senators to cast a vote on a nonbinding resolution for or against the plan.\nThey also sought to frame the clash with the White House on their terms, using language reminiscent of the Vietnam War era to suggest that increasing the United States military presence in Iraq would be a mistake.\n\"We believe that there is a number of Republicans who will join with us to say no to escalation,\" said the Senate mority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada.\n\"I really believe that if we can come up with a bipartisan approach to this escalation, we will do more to change the direction of that war in Iraq than any other thing that we can do.\"\nOn the eve of the president's Iraq speech, the White House sent Frederick W. Kagan, a military analyst who helped develop the troop increase plan, to meet with the Senate Republican Policy Committee.\nBut Republican officials conceded that at least 10 of their own senators were likely to oppose the plan to increase troops levels in Iraq.\nAnd Democrats were proposing their resolution with that in mind, hoping to send a forceful message that as many as 60 senators believed strengthening American forces in Baghdad was the wrong approach.\nDemocratic leaders said they expect all but a few of their senators to back the resolution.\nIn an interview on Tuesday, Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, said he was becoming increasingly skeptical that a troop increase was in the best interest of the United States.\n\"I'm particularly concerned about the greater injection of our troops into the middle of sectarian violence.\nWhom do you shoot at, the Sunni or the Shia?\"\nMr. Warner said.\n\"Our American G.I.\n's should not be subjected to that type of risk.\"\nBut the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said Congress could not supplant the authority of the president.\n\"You can't run a war by a committee of 435 in the House and 100 in the Senate,\" he said.\nThe White House press secretary, Tony Snow, criticized the Democrats' plans.\n\"We understand that the resolution is purely symbolic, but the war -- and the necessity of succeeding in Iraq -- are very real,\" he said Tuesday night.\nOn Thursday, Democrats in the House and Senate will open a series of hearings on the Iraq war.\nDefense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice are among those who have agreed to testify.\nSenator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who is the new chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said that if he was not satisfied that Mr. Bush's plan has sufficient incentives and penalties for the Iraqis, he might support a resolution or amendment to cap the number of American troops in Iraq.\n\"We have got to force the Iraqis to take charge of their own country,\" Mr. Levin said at a breakfast meeting with reporters.\n\"We can't save them from themselves.\nIt is a political solution.\nIt is no longer a military solution.\"\nLawmakers said Senate Democrats appeared broadly united in opposition to Mr. Bush's approach during their private luncheon on Tuesday.\nWhile there were a few senators who favored cutting off money for any troop increase, a handful of others expressed uncertainty about challenging the president on a potential war-powers issue.\n\"We have to be very careful about blocking funding for any troops because we don't want to leave our troops short-changed,\" said Senator Mary L.

effectively put on hold, and most significantly no progress being made on any Brexit deal.\nThe vote of no confidence in May will be carried out by the so-called 1922 Committee, the representative group for Conservative MPs.\nThe vote was triggered early on Wednesday morning when the necessary quota of 48 letters from MPs asking for a leadership vote was reached, which represents 15 percent of

vote in order to stay as leader,\" constitutional expert Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University London (QMUL), told Xinhua.\nThe rules of the leadership process state that the leader can face just one confidence vote in a year, so if May wins on Wednesday evening she will be immune from challenges until next December.\nHowever, if the vote is a close one May could feel that she is too politically damaged to continue, and she would step down as leader and prime minister.\n\"You can win a confidence vote by one vote and stay in place, but I would suggest that that kind of

as a result of the vote, then the Conservative Party will immediately begin the process of choosing a leader, who will become the new prime minister.\nThe head of the 1922 Committee Graham Brady will agree a date for the first round of the leadership election with the prime minister.\nThen, candidates for leader will come forward from among Conservative MPs.\nEach candidate needs just two other MPs to nominate them for the election.\nThis could see an initially large field of candidates running for leadership, and a series of votes will be held among Conservative MPs.\nIn each round of the vote, the lowest polling leadership candidate will fall out of the race until there are just two left.\nBoth those candidates will then be put to a postal ballot by the entire membership of the Conservative Party across the whole of Great Britain.\nFigures from March this year show that this electorate is about 124,000 strong.\nMay went through the initial parts of this process in the summer

initial rounds of voting among Conservative MPs to reduce the field to two candidates took 10 days, and a postal ballot of party members was not necessary as the other candidate in the election with

on a resolution concerning the Yemen conflict, the Senate unanimously passed a separate one that blames the Saudi crown prince for Khashoggi's murder and urges Saudi Arabia to hold accountable anyone responsible for his death.\nIn the first resolution, lawmakers recommended that the U.S. government should stop its backing of the Saudi-led operation in Yemen, despite the briefings of senior officials like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense James Mattis last month.\nIn the second resolution, the Senate believed that the Saudi crown prince is \"responsible for the murder\" of Khashoggi, and urging the Saudi Arabian government to \"ensure appropriate accountability.\"\nThe bipartisan votes came amid the Capitol Hill's growing outrage over high civilian

run-up to the election voiced different views to Abe on constitutional reform and economic policies and ended up mounting a far-bigger challenge to the incumbent than expected.\nLocal political observers pointed out that while Abe has secured the top party post for a third-consecutive term, effectively ensuring his position as the nation's next prime minister owing to the ruling coalition's majorities in both chambers of parliament, Ishiba garnering far more support than expected from rank-and-file members has certainly raised some red flags looking ahead.\nWhile Abe won 329 out of ballots cast by Diet members, and 224 by rank-and-file members, Ishiba secured 73 votes from legislators but an unexpected 181 votes from ordinary members, who closely reflect public opinion.\nThis, political analysts said, was to a certain extent down to increasing opposition to the prime minister's long reign amid ongoing cronyism allegations, ineffectual economic policies and the railroading through parliament of contentious legislation, including those related to security, to push forward his constitutional reform agenda.\nThe underwhelming support in the leadership election, described by political watchers here as a \"backlash\" by the LDP's rank-and-file members, is \"most certainly\" reflected in public opinion, specialists in politics and national ideology have

international relations,\" Dr. Shin Chiba, professor with Special Appointment, who specializes in political theory, said.\nAbe, following his victory, was quick to reiterate his plans to forge ahead with his career goal of revising the nation's Supreme Law for the first time since World War II, having controversially and against public and constitutional experts' opinions redefined the role of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) three years ago, to allow it to take part in collective-self defense and come to the aid of an ally under attack, even if its own territory is not threatened.\nHenceforth, Abe will thus seek to secure the two-thirds majority needed in both houses of parliament and a majority in a national referendum to bring about his legacy-led revisions to the constitution, which will specifically make reference to the SDF and \"purportedly\" clear up its current constitutional ambiguity.\nHowever, as recent polls have suggested, the Japanese public are far more concerned about the dire fiscal health of the nation, rather than the prime minister's singular goal of revising the Supreme Law for the first time since it took effect in 1947.\nAbe's reasons for constitutional reform are both personal and political.\nHe is a long-time devotee of constitutional reform and has used geopolitical pretexts to push forward his reforms, noted Tina Burrett, Associate Professor of Political Science at Sophia University.\n\"The public are split on the issue of reform... for most voters, however, the economy and public services are far more important issues,\" she said.\nHer sentiments have been echoed by other experts on the matter, with Yu Uchiyama, a political scientist at the University of Tokyo, believing Abe's constitutional agenda is far from a straightforward one, with a public mandate on the issue possibly going awry.\n\"Even if Abe manages to force a revision through parliament, he would face a referendum, raising the prospect of a Brexit-style political meltdown if the people vote against him,\" Uchiyama said.\nWith public support for the premier and his Cabinet tepid at best amid myriad cronyism scandals and economic malaise perpetrated by a vastly unclear blueprint as to how to deal with the nation's ballooning social welfare costs related to its rapidly aging and shrinking society, security issues are currently not a public priority, political experts have attested.\nChristian Collet, from International Christian University's Politics and International Relations faculty maintained that the Japanese populace believe that Article 9 of Japan's pacifist charter, that states that Japanese people forever renounce war and that land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained, despite Abe's aspirations, should remain as is.\n\"Significant segments of the public will continue to resist the efforts to revise Article 9 and there is near unanimous opposition to Japan becoming a nuclear power,\" the expert said.\nWith Abe only gaining about 55 percent of all votes at the local level in the leadership election, members in the ruling camp have been quoted as saying the figures were \"shocking,\" particularly as they closely reflect public opinion.\nLDP party members have also said that the worse-than-expected voting numbers could suggest that victory in the upper house

Ricci perfume in a charity collection box and brought it home.\nIt contained Novichok.\nBasu said police had no doubt the events were linked, and were discussing charges over the Sturgess and Rowley

amnesty first came to public attention in May, ahead of June 24 Turkish parliament elections, as part of the election campaign of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).\nThe nationalist party's leader

called for actions to deal with them.\nAs Mati's local authorities are still trying to heal the wounds of fire, Christos Zerefos, Supervisor of the Research Center for Atmospheric Physics and Climatology of the Academy of Athens and member of various International Scientific Committees, warned in a recent interview with Xinhua that the climate change will make us more often face extreme

and international level by the end of the 21st century, the cost of natural disasters in our country will amount to 700 billion euros (823.8 billion U.S. dollars).\nIt is twice the debt of Greece,\"

battlefield after bombardment.\nThe signs of disaster are still visible, as hundreds of gutted houses are left in ruins and people are still accommodated at camps, according to Zerefos.\nThe Greek prime minister has requested their scientific knowledge and experience for dealing with natural disasters and avoiding such tragedies in the future.\nOne of the main causes of the fire, according to Zerefos, is that the firefighting forces did not manage to control it in the first five minutes, as strong winds were blowing in the area.\nAnother bad estimate was that the wind would change direction and that Marathon Avenue, where Marathon race was born 2,500 years ago, would serve as a natural obstacle to the blazes, something that did not happen.\n\"In the disaster, except from the pine trees, more than 200 cars were also burned in the area.\nThe burning of cars equals to about one and a half gasoline tank, explosions occurred and temperatures rose too much, having reached 1,300 degrees Celsius.\nSo it was like a war, as if the area had been bombarded,\" Zerefos explained.\nFor Zerefos, preventing such kind of disaster from happening again is also very important.\n\"If we strengthen the prevention and protection mechanisms, a process that has already begun, this cost will be reduced to around 400 billion euros (470.7 billion U.S. dollars).\nIt is important therefore to

Agency (JMA) said.\nA wave of up to 1.4 meters (4.5 ft) high was recorded at Sendai, about 70 km (45 miles) north of Fukushima, with smaller waves hitting ports elsewhere along the coast, public broadcaster NHK said.\nTelevision footage showed ships moving out to sea from harbors as tsunami warnings wailed after alerts of waves of up to 3 meters (10 feet) were issued.\n\u201cWe saw high waves but nothing that went over the tidal barriers,\u201d a man in the city of Iwaki told NTV television network.\nAerial footage showed tsunami waves flowing up rivers in some areas, and some fishing boats were overturned in the port of Higashi-Matsushima before the JMA lifted its warnings.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey measured Tuesday\u2019s quake at magnitude 6.9, down from an initial 7.3.\nAll Japan\u2019s nuclear power plants in the area have been shut down in the wake of the March 2011 disaster, which knocked out cooling systems at Tokyo Electric Power Co\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, causing reactors to melt down and spew radiation into the air, soil and sea.\nThe cooling system for a storage pool for spent nuclear fuel at the reactor at its Fukushima Daini Plant was initially halted on Tuesday, said a spokeswoman for Tokyo Electric Power, known as Tepco, but was restarted soon after.\nOnly two reactors are operating in Japan, both in the southwest.\nNuclear plants need cooling systems operating even when in shutdown to keep spent fuel cool.\nTohoku Electric Power Co said there was no damage to its Onagawa nuclear plant, while the Kyodo news agency reported there were no irregularities at the Tokai Daini nuclear plant in Ibaraki prefecture.\nCOAST EVACUATED\nJapanese Minister for Disaster Management Jun Matsumoto told reporters there had been no reports of significant injuries.\nOne woman suffered cuts to her head from falling dishes, Kyodo reported, citing fire department officials.\nEarthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world\u2019s most seismically active areas.\nJapan accounts for about 20 percent of the world\u2019s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.\nThe March 11, 2011, quake was magnitude 9, the strongest quake ever recorded in Japan.\nThe massive tsunami it generated knocked out the Fukushima Daiichi plant, causing the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl a quarter of a century earlier.\nSystems have been updated since the 2011 disaster to spread warnings more quickly, said Tsunetaka Omine, head of the Disaster Management Division in Iwaki, a city in Fukushima prefecture.\nPreviously, there were complicated directions on where to evacuate.\n\u201cBut now, we basically just tell people to head away from the sea, to the highest possible ground,\u201d Omine said.\nAuthorities now also send tsunami warnings to every mobile phone in the area and broadcast on local radio.\nStaying in a traditional Japanese inn on the coast in the city of Ofunato with a dozen international high school students on a study tour, teacher Kathy Krauth said the shaking began just seconds after a quake alarm on her phone went off.\n\u201cI felt like the lessons of 3-11 were really taken to heart,\u201d said Krauth, who teaches a class on the March 2011 disaster and its aftermath.\n\u201cThe feeling was, we just don\u2019t know, but we\u2019re going to be as cautious as we can.\u201d\nNissan Motor Co said it would suspend work at its engine factory in Fukushima at least until the latest tsunami warning was lifted.\nA spokesman said there were no injuries or damage at the plant, which was badly damaged in the 2011 disaster.\nToyota Motor Corp said all its factories in northeastern Japan were operating as usual.\nJapan\u2019s famous Shinkansen bullet trains were halted along one stretch of track and some other train lines were also stopped.\nJapanese financial markets were little affected, with the Nikkei 225 index closing up 0.3 percent and the yen steady against the U.S. dollar.",

moved into an apartment and began planning a new, higher home at the same location.\nIt has been roughly nine months since Hurricane Harvey dumped trillions of gallons of water on the U.S. Gulf Coast, killing 68 people and causing an estimated $125 billion in property damage.\nShields and some 25,000 Texas households are still displaced, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\nNearly 80,000 homes across Texas had 18 inches of floodwater or more during Harvey.\nIn Houston, data on people still out of their homes and awaiting repairs are not available from the city.\nBut U.S.\nPostal Service figures show 11,500 Houston homes became vacant between June 2017 and February 2018.\nWith the 2018 hurricane season beginning June 1, around 400 Houston households are

residents and neighborhood groups, many owners of flooded homes are still enmeshed in the emotionally fraught and expensive process of deciding whether to repair or elevate, or put their property up for sale.\nShields said the months since Harvey have been tough and fears that another major storm before the region fully recovers would be devastating.\n\u201cI can survive this once - health, wealth, physically - but I can\u2019t do it again,\u201d he said.\nAfter three floods since 2014, local officials have added home-building restrictions and rules on rebuilding in flood-prone areas, giving owners of damaged homes costly new factors to consider.\nHouston officials this year passed an ordinance requiring certain dwellings to be raised to the 500-year floodplain level plus two feet.\nPreviously, only new homes had to start one foot above the 100-year level.\nJACKED UP HOMES\nThe requirements have forced some owners to jack up existing homes to avoid the next flood.\nHouston homes, typically built on slab foundations, can be mechanically raised for an average cost of $100,000 to $300,000 in a months-long project, said Wayne Fairley, a managing director at house elevating company Planet Three Elevation.\nFairley has tripled his workforce since Harvey to meet growing demand, he said.\nSubcontractors who once handled plumbing and electrical projects for the company now

of his work is in Houston\u2019s Meyerland neighborhood, which was hit by three major floods in recent years.\nNancy Wilson and her husband decided to tear down and build anew rather than spend the estimated $250,000 to raise and then remodel their 1950s home.\nThe new house will be six feet higher than the old one, which got two feet of water during Harvey.\n\u201cI\u2019m almost positive it will flood again,\u201d said Wilson, a therapist, who hopes to move back by early next year.\nIn the interim, the family is living a few miles away in a rental property.\n\u201cHonestly, I wish we

schools and gated subdivisions.\nHer house flooded after the city released water from a nearby reservoir to relieve stress on a dam, forcing her to find temporary housing.\nNow, most mornings she drops her 14-year-old daughter off long before school has opened and picks her up hours after it has closed because the school system lacks funding to provide transportation from her current location.\n\u201cIt\u2019s concerning when I\u2019m dropping her off at a dark school,\u201d McGlory said, who is worried the transportation issues will continue into the next school year.\nMcGlory says she received $33,000 from FEMA after Harvey.\nOf that, $17,000 was earmarked for home repairs, despite bids from contractors pegging her damages closer to $70,000.\nThe Red Cross worker recently was accepted to a rebuild and repair program run by a community group.\n\u201cI\u2019m so overwhelmed.\nI am working and a single parent with two kids.\nI\u2019ve never rebuilt a house before,\u201d said McGlory, who had no flood insurance because her house was not in a floodplain.\nWhile McGlory considered selling her property, an investor shortly after the storm offered $100,000 less than what she had paid for it.\nHistorically, home values in hard-hit areas can fall between 7 and 20 percent immediately after a flood, said Ed Wolff, president of real estate firm Beth Wolff Realtors and

in 1985, recently submitted a grant for state funding to buy homes damaged by Harvey.\nIt has also focused on repairs to drainage infrastructure and removing debris from Harvey that could block

Gen. Tod Bunting, the state's adjutant general.\nThe Guard would also usually have 170 medium-scale tactical vehicles used to transport people and supplies -- but now it has fewer than 30, he said.\nOn the other hand, General Bunting said, it had more cargo trucks than it needed.\nThe issue is not confined to Kansas.\nIn Ohio, the National Guard is short of night vision goggles and M-4 rifles, said a Guard spokesman, Dr. Mark Wayda.\n\"If we had a tornado hit a small town, we would be fine,\" Dr. Wayda said.\n\"If we had a much larger event, that would become a problem.\"\nThe California National Guard is similarly concerned about a catastrophic event.\n\"Our issue is that we are shortchanged when it comes to equipment,\" said Col. Jon Siepmann, a spokesman for the Guard in California.\n\"We have gone from a strategic reserve to a globally deployable force, and yet our equipment resources have been largely the same levels since before the war.\"\nIn Arkansas, Gov.\nMike Beebe a Democrat, echoed the concerns of Ms. Sebelius.\n\"We have the same problem,\" Mr. Beebe said.\n\"We have had a significant decrease in equipment traditionally afforded our National Guard, and it's occasioned by the fact that it's been sent to the Middle East and Iraq.\"\nHe added: \"Our first and foremost consideration is to guarantee that our soldiers have the resources, including equipment, to do the job and protect themselves.\nHaving said that, my preference would be for the federal government to provide that equipment and not strip the state's resources, which could adversely impact the state's mission in times of crisis, which is what happened in Kansas.\"\nLast year, all 50 governors signed a letter to President Bush asking for the immediate re-equipping of Guard units sent overseas.\nBut officials in several states, including Kentucky, Minnesota and Texas, said Tuesday that they were not facing equipment shortages.\nNational Guard units overseas are often assigned engineering missions, and the skills and equipment -- bulldozers and trucks, for example -- are also what might be required to deal with a natural disaster at home.\nWhite House officials said that the Kansas National Guard had at its disposal in the Midwest and the Plains states, everything it needed.\nBy Mr.\nSnow's count, that included 83,000 National Guard soldiers; 99 bulldozers; 61 loaders; 246 dump trucks and 59 graders.\n\"There's a lot of stuff available,\" Mr.\nSnow said.\n\"So, again, I think this is one where the equipment was available and everybody was moving as rapidly as possible.\"\nIn Congressional testimony, senior National Guard officials have said that since Sept. 11 units under their command had equipment shortages as forces deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.\nResponding to concerns that the National Guard would not have sufficient personnel or equipment to respond to natural disasters, Guard leaders and state officials developed plans to ensure that if a state is in short supply of people or gear when a hurricane or tornado strikes, it can borrow from other states.\nBut borrowing does not solve every problem, state officials said, and coordination can take time.\nThe destruction from Hurricane Katrina ultimately required the help of 50,000 troops -- and they came from all 50 states.\nTraining is another issue.\nAt a Washington news conference in February, Ms. Sebelius said, \"The Guard cannot train on equipment they do not have.\"\nShe added later: \"And in a state like Kansas, where tornados, floods, blizzards and wildfires can seemingly happen all at once, we need our Guardsmen to be as prepared as possible.\"\nTwo recent reports have raised questions about Guard preparedness.\nAn independent military assessment council, the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves, released a report in March that stated: \"In particular, the equipment readiness of the Army National Guard is unacceptable and has reduced the capability of the United States to respond to current and additional major contingencies, foreign and domestic.\"\nAnother report, released in January by the Government Accountability Office, concluded that the ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have \"significantly decreased\" the amount of equipment available for National Guard units not deployed overseas, while the same units face an increasing number of threats at home.\nLate Tuesday, in a statement, Ms. Sebelius repeated her message:\n\"I have said for nearly two years, and will continue to say, that we have a looming crisis on our hands when it comes to National Guard equipment in Iraq and our needs here at home.\"", "output_sentences": ["For months, Gov.",

after the storm hit and asking the federal government to fill them -- but did not.", "\"If you don't request it, you're not going to get it,\" Mr.", "Snow told reporters on Tuesday morning.", "The debate was reminiscent of the Bush administration's skirmishes with Gov.", "Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana, also a Democrat, after Hurricane Katrina.", "But after an angry flurry of words, both sides seemed to back down a bit later Tuesday.", "Ms. Sibelius said she now had enough equipment and personnel to deal with the problems in Greensburg, and the White House acknowledged that the governor had requested several items that the federal government supplied, including a mobile command center, a mobile office building, an urban search and rescue team, and coordination of extra Black Hawk helicopters.", "Nonetheless, the governor and officials in other states again expressed concern that the problem could occur again as the stretched National Guard system struggled to respond to disasters at home while also fighting overseas.", "As State Senator Donald Betts Jr., Democrat of Wichita, put it: \"We should have had National Guard troops there right after the tornado hit, securing the place, pulling up debris, to make sure that if there was still life, people could have been saved.", "The response time was too slow, and it's becoming a trend.", "We saw this after Katrina, and it's like history repeating itself.\"", "The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which came under strong criticism after Hurricane Katrina, seemed to respond more quickly in Kansas.", "Several of the agency's mobile disaster recovery centers are in Greensburg assisting residents, and the agency said it had moved in 15,000 gallons of water and 21,000 ready-to-eat meals, enough to feed 10,000 people.", "State officials said the problem with the National Guard's response had more to do with equipment than personnel.", "In Kansas, the National Guard is operating with 40 percent to 50 percent of its vehicles and heavy machinery, local Guard officials said.", "Ordinarily, the Guard would have about 660 Humvees and more than 30 large trucks to traverse difficult terrain and transport heavy equipment.", "When the tornado struck, the Guard had about 350 Humvees and 15 large trucks, said Maj. Gen. Tod Bunting, the state's adjutant general.", "The Guard would also usually have 170 medium-scale tactical vehicles used to transport people and supplies -- but now it has fewer than 30, he said.", "On the other hand, General Bunting said, it had more cargo trucks than it needed.", "The issue is not confined to Kansas.", "In Ohio, the National Guard is short of night vision goggles and M-4 rifles, said a Guard spokesman, Dr. Mark Wayda.", "\"If we had a tornado hit a small town, we would be fine,\" Dr. Wayda said.", "\"If we had a much larger event, that would become a problem.\"", "The California National Guard is similarly concerned about a catastrophic event.", "\"Our issue is that we are shortchanged when it comes to equipment,\" said Col. Jon Siepmann, a spokesman for the Guard in California.", "\"We have gone from a strategic reserve to a globally deployable force, and yet our equipment resources have been largely the same levels since before the war.\"", "In Arkansas, Gov.", "Mike Beebe a Democrat, echoed the concerns of Ms. Sebelius.", "\"We have the same problem,\" Mr. Beebe said.", "\"We have had a significant decrease in equipment traditionally afforded our National Guard, and it's occasioned by the fact that it's been sent to the Middle East and Iraq.\"", "He added: \"Our first and foremost consideration is to guarantee that our soldiers have the resources, including equipment, to do the job and protect themselves.", "Having said that, my preference would be for the federal government to provide that equipment and not strip the state's resources, which could adversely impact the state's mission in times of crisis, which is what happened in Kansas.\"", "Last year, all 50 governors signed a letter to President Bush asking for the immediate re-equipping of Guard units sent overseas.", "But officials in several states, including Kentucky, Minnesota and Texas, said Tuesday that they were not facing equipment shortages.", "National Guard units overseas are often assigned engineering missions, and the skills and equipment -- bulldozers and trucks, for example -- are also what might be required to deal with a natural disaster at home.", "White House officials said that the Kansas National Guard had at its disposal in the Midwest and the Plains states, everything it needed.", "By Mr.", "Snow's count, that included 83,000 National Guard soldiers; 99 bulldozers; 61 loaders; 246 dump trucks and 59 graders.", "\"There's a lot of stuff available,\" Mr.", "Snow said.", "\"So, again, I think this is one where the equipment was available and everybody was moving as rapidly as possible.\"", "In Congressional testimony, senior National Guard officials have said that since Sept. 11 units under their command had equipment shortages as forces deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.", "Responding to concerns that the National Guard would not have sufficient personnel or equipment to respond to natural disasters, Guard leaders and state officials developed plans to ensure that if a state is in short supply of people or gear when a hurricane or tornado strikes, it can borrow from other states.", "But borrowing does not solve every problem, state officials said, and coordination can take time.", "The destruction from Hurricane Katrina ultimately required the help of 50,000 troops -- and they came from all 50 states.", "Training is another issue.", "At a Washington news conference in February, Ms. Sebelius said, \"The Guard cannot train on equipment they do not have.\"", "She added later: \"And in a state like Kansas, where tornados, floods, blizzards and wildfires can seemingly happen all at once, we need our Guardsmen to be as prepared as possible.\"", "Two recent reports have raised questions about Guard preparedness.", "An independent military assessment council, the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves, released a report in March that stated: \"In particular, the equipment readiness of the Army National Guard is unacceptable and has reduced the capability of the United States to respond to current and additional major contingencies, foreign and domestic.\"", "Another report, released in January by the Government Accountability Office, concluded that the ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have \"significantly decreased\" the amount of equipment available for National Guard units not deployed overseas, while the same units face an increasing number of threats at home.", "Late Tuesday, in a statement, Ms. Sebelius repeated her message:", "\"I have said for nearly two years, and will continue to say, that we have a looming crisis on our hands when it comes to National Guard equipment in Iraq and our needs here at home.\""], "discourse": [6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 6, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 6, 3, 6, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 6, 4, 6, 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6]}

Massino took the witness stand in 2011, becoming the first official boss of one of New York\u2019s five crime families to break the code of silence and testify against a former confederate, he offered a succinct explanation for his departure from mob tradition.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping to see a light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d he said.\nOn Wednesday, the tunnel got a whole lot shorter: A federal judge commuted Massino\u2019s sentence of two consecutive life terms in prison.\nMassino, the former boss of the Bonanno crime family, will be released from federal custody in 60 days, a period the government requested to put in place security arrangements to keep Massino safe from what are presumed to be a considerable number of enemies.\nFederal prosecutors in Brooklyn had sought a reduction of Massino\u2019s sentence, citing his extensive cooperation: While incarcerated, Massino had recorded conversations with a Mafia captain, and he has provided investigators with information about hundreds of people associated with not only the Bonanno family, which Massino took control of in 1991, but also the other crime families across New York.\nAt a brief hearing in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn on Wednesday, Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis credited the government\u2019s arguments and decided to undo the sentence of two life terms that he had originally meted out to Massino.\nWhen that sentence was handed down, in 2005, clapping could be heard in his courtroom.\nBut on Wednesday, the judge said that in deciding to free Massino after more than 10 years of incarceration, he had considered the aging mobster\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cooperation with the government and his willingness to place himself at grave personal risk.\u201d\nOnce released, Massino will probably receive a new identity and live elsewhere in the United States, his lawyer, Edward A.

Thursday that its Supreme Court had sentenced a U.S. citizen to 15 years of hard labor for committing hostile acts against its government.\nKenneth Bae, 44, a Korean-American from Washington state who ran a tour business out of China, was arrested in the special economic zone of Rason in northeastern North Korea in November after leading a group of businessmen there from Yanji, China.\nOn Saturday, the North said it was indicting him on charges that he tried to overthrow Pyongyang\u2019s government.\nOn Thursday, the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said the Supreme Court had sentenced Bae during a hearing Tuesday.\nThe court convicted him of \u201chostile acts,\u201d a charge less grave than the original charge that prosecutors pressed.\nThe crime of trying to overthrow the government could have resulted in the death penalty.\nUnder North Korean law, Bae should be transferred to a labor camp within 10 days of the ruling.\nThe ruling came amid high tensions between Pyongyang and Washington and could complicate Washington\u2019s diplomatic balancing act as it tries to hold a tough line with North Korea over its nuclear program.\nSouth Korean human rights advocates have said Bae not only ran tours to North Korea but also was interested in helping orphans there.\nThey said security officials in the North might have been offended by pictures of orphans that Bae had taken and stored in his computer.\nNorth Korea has often used the plight of detained Americans as a bargaining chip in its dealings with Washington.\nSome were freed only after former U.S. presidents traveled to the North to seek their release.\nIn 2009, North Korea arrested two U.S. journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who it said had entered illegally and committed \u201chostile
