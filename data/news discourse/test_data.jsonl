fund, Third Point LLC, people familiar with the matter said.\nThird Point unveiled a slate of nominees on Friday to replace Campbell\u2019s 12-member board, pushing it to more actively explore a sale

Keith McLoughlin, who has served as interim CEO since Morrison\u2019s departure, has said he is not interested in the job on a permanent basis.\nThat has added to pressure on Campbell to find a leader who will help it execute an ambitious turnaround plan it unveiled last month.\nDespite Morrison\u2019s exit almost four months ago, the board has only recently taken formal steps to look externally for a new CEO, according to the sources.\nMignini, 55, joined Campbell five years ago and was promoted in April to be its COO, putting the Italian-educated executive in charge of the U.S.

at $40.40 in early morning trading on Monday, giving the company a market capitalization of about $12 billion.\nThird Point\u2019s board challenge could complicate the CEO selection process, given that shareholders could choose to replace board members who will be making that decision, in a vote that could be scheduled as early as November.\nThe turmoil could discourage some of the consumer

Crawford, the company's chief executive, and other executives.\nUnder the terms of the deal, nine Caremark executives will join the combined company and Mr. Crawford will become chairman of its board and receive an estimated $48 million in exit pay.\nWhile he would probably receive a similar amount if Caremark sold out to Express Scripts, Mr. Crawford might not be asked to join the combined company under the terms of such a deal.\nThe Louisiana pension fund also noted that the CVS deal guarantees a job at the merged company for Mr. Crawford's son, Andrew.\nA Caremark proxy filed last year described the younger Mr. Crawford as senior vice president for industry analysis and underwriting.\nThe merger with CVS would also allow an unspecified number of Caremark directors -- perhaps all of them -- to get lucrative seats on the combined company's board.\nIn its offer, CVS has also agreed to cover any costs associated with stock option backdating at Caremark, practices that are under federal investigation and the subject of another civil suit filed against the company in Tennessee.\nThat lawsuit has challenged 4.6 million options granted to Mr. Crawford as having been possibly backdated.\nStock sales covered by those options generated $262 million for Mr. Crawford, the Tennessee lawsuit contends.\n\"The inequities could not be more apparent,\" said Gerald H. Silk, a lawyer at Bernstein, Litowitz, Berger & Grossmann, one of the firms representing the Louisiana fund.\n\"Shareholders get a coercive, zero-premium deal while Crawford gets a $48 million payout, jobs for himself and his son and complete indemnification for his alleged option backdating transgressions.\"\nA Caremark spokesman called the pension fund's lawsuit meritless and said the company would defend against it vigorously.\nAs for the Express Scripts suit, he said it was a \"frivolous\" attempt to interfere with the CVS merger.\n\"Contrary to allegations made by Express Scripts, the provisions of the CVS merger agreement are lawful and appropriate,\" the spokesman said.\nTo be sure, many of the terms in the CVS bid for Caremark -- the no-shop provisions and last-look opportunity -- are common in the merger world.\nBut the suit filed in Delaware, comes at a time when directors' actions as fiduciaries for their shareholders are under increased scrutiny.\nAs a result, the case, which is being heard by Chancellor William B. Chandler III, provides an opportunity for him to opine on the matter of directors' duties broadly and whether the Caremark directors exercised those obligations in particular.\nThis is familiar territory for Chancellor Chandler, who oversaw the Disney case of 2005.\nIn that case he chastised the company's directors for essentially rubberstamping a contract struck by Michael D.

agriculture-based economy as it remains among the top producers of commodities including wheat, rice, cotton, cereals, vegetables and fruits, milk and milk products.\nNearly 70 percent of India's population still lives in villages and depends, directly or indirectly, on agriculture for earning a livelihood.\nAgriculture contributes to the extent of 18 percent towards India's gross domestic product (GDP), even as the country accounts for nearly 7 percent of total global agricultural output.\nAs per the fourth advance estimates (released in August) for the year 2017-2018, total food grains production in the country was estimated at 284.83 million tons which was higher by 9.72 million tons than the previous record production of foodgrain of 275.11 million tons achieved during 2016-2017.\nHowever, despite all this rosy picture, farmers in India are a dejected lot these days, and are venting out their anger against the government's policies, which they allege, overlook their interests and basic needs.\nBarely able to recover their basic costs, the farmers allege that agriculture is fast turning into an unfeasible activity.\nFed up after not being able to sell his onion produce of around 750 kg at a price more than 1.41 Indian Rupees (around 2 cents) per kg, a farmer in India's southwestern state Maharashtra sent whatever money he could receive by selling his total produce to Prime Minister Narendra Modi through a money order as a mark of protest and to highlight the farmers' plight.\nSanjay Sathe, the farmer from Maharashtra's Nasik district, reportedly said, \"I produced 750 kg of onion this season but was offered a rate of one Indian rupee per kilogram at Niphad wholesale market last week.\nFinally I could negotiate a deal for 1.40 Indian rupees per kilogram and received 1,064 Indian rupees for 750 kg.\nIt was painful to see such paltry returns on four months of toil.\nHence I have donated 1,064 Indian Rupees to Prime Minister Disaster Relief Fund as a protest.\nI had to pay additional 54 Indian rupees for sending it by money order.\"\nInterestingly, Sathe was among the selected few \"progressive farmers\" who were picked by the Union Agriculture Ministry in 2010 to interact with former U.S. President Barack Obama during the latter's visit.\nStrangely, while on one hand, the farmers are not able to recover their bare minimum cost, on the other hand, the retailers are openly selling the same commodity at least 20 times the cost which is paid to the farmers, thereby reaping heavy profits.\nSribhagwan Singh, a farmer in Kanganheri village located in southwest Delhi, laments that he grew garlic on his farms and reaped a harvest of around 800 kg, but is not able to sell it in the market as he is getting a price of not more than 10 Indian rupees per kg.\n\"The bare minimum cost which I incurred in growing this garlic produce was at least 25 Indian rupees per kilogram.\nFor over the past three months I have been contacting vendors in big vegetable markets in and around Delhi, but not able to find a buyer of my produce for more than 10 Indian rupees per kilogram.\nThe final conclusion is that farming is a loss making entity in India, and farmers have no option but to quit it and look for some alternative source of income,\" he told Xinhua.\nHe added that the same garlic was being sold in retail market in Delhi and surrounding areas at the rate of 150 Indian rupees per kg.\nOnly a few days ago, thousands of farmers congregated in Delhi from across the country and carried out a two-day agitation against the central government, demanding loan waivers and increase in minimum support prices (MSPs) for their agriculture produce.\nDue to big amounts of loans standing in their names and finding no possibilities of getting a stable income from agriculture, the farmers are driven to a situation where they find no alternative but to commit suicides.\nFarmers suicides has a major cause of concern in India for many years now, with the state of Maharashtra being on top.\nThe country's Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, however, claims that the number of farmers suicides in on the decline.\nA couple of months ago he informed the parliament that the number of farmers suicides and agricultural laborers during 2016 had come down approximately by 9.77 percent compared to the previous years.\n\"The number of suicides has come down from 12,602 in 2015 to 11,370 in 2016,\" he was quoted as saying.\nThe maximum number of these suicides were reported from the state of Maharashtra.\nThe main reasons behind agriculture being a loss making activity in India is the large dependence on monsoons and lack of use of modern farming techniques.\nDue to non-availability of water resources round the year, a large chunk of farmers depend on monsoon rains.\nAt times, due to poor rains, or floods caused by excess rains, standing crops get damaged thereby resulting in huge losses to the farmers.\nBesides, use of traditional farming methods and non-acceptance of modern equipment and techniques, also results in poor produce in terms of yield per hectare, as compared to other countries.\nIn a bid to address the farmers' woes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced that a new agriculture export policy will be unveiled soon to boost farm income as the government was on track to achieve the target of doubling farmers' income by 2022.\nThe main thrust of the policy would be fixing the minimum support price (MSP) of crops at least 1.5 times of the cost of production.\nThe Crop Insurance Schemes have been in place as a means of protecting the agriculturist against financial losses due to uncertainties that may arise from crop failures or losses arising from named or all unforeseen perils beyond their control.\nOne such scheme - Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) (or, Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme) aims at supporting sustainable production in agriculture sector by way of providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of unforeseen events; stabilizing their income to ensure their continuance in farming; encouraging farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices; ensuring flow of credit to the agriculture sector which will contribute to food security, crop diversification and

shareholders.\nDescendants of former Campbell Soup Chairman John Dorrance own a combined 42 percent stake in the company, representing a major hurdle.\nThird Point gave the U.S. company five days to

executive, according to Third Point\u2019s \u201cdemand letter,\u201d dated and delivered to Campbell Soup on Wednesday.\nIn the letter, the hedge fund cites a New Jersey statute that gives shareholders the right to review company documents, provided they demonstrate a \u201cproper purpose\u201d for looking at the records.\nThis sets the stage for a legal battle with Campbell Soup, should it refuse access to the records.\nCampbell Soup, based in Camden, New Jersey, did not respond to a request for comment on how it would respond to Third Point\u2019s demands.\nIn a press release

Steyer, Farallon's senior managing partner, wrote investors in a letter in 2000.\nA 2005 article in the newsletter Tax Notes said Duke University sought to keep 25 percent of its endowment, which now stands at $7.4 billion, invested in hedge funds.\nAt the time, about 75 percent of Duke's hedge fund investments were in offshore funds, according to the article, written by Maximilian H.

legal agencies, including the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP), Ministry of Public Security, and Ministry of Justice, have been respectively carrying out their national workshops and have announced annual work plans recently.\nPolitical and legal workers are urged to carry out their duties to further promote fairness, transparency and efficiency.\nUPROOT GANGS AND ORGANIZED CRIMES\nPolice will fight more resolutely against gangs and organized crime, and eradicate the political, economic and social conditions that foster such crime in 2018, minister of public security Zhao Kezhi said at the ministry's workshop.\nThe ministry on Wednesday announced the launch of a two-year national campaign against crime involving guns and explosives, the latest move echoing the calling.\nThe crackdown will target the manufacturing and sales of guns and explosives within China and the smuggling of related goods from overseas.\nAlso on Wednesday, three law-enforcement departments jointly began a campaign to crack down on gambling in rural areas, especially on mafia-style gangs involved in gambling-related activities.\nProcurator-General Cao Jianming ordered prosecutors across the country to strengthen the fight against gang crime into a \"crushing tide.\"\nThe SPP later issued a notice asking procuratorates at all levels to step up punishment for gang crime and its protective \"umbrellas.\"\nThese gestures came after the central authorities announced a new campaign against gangs and organized crime, and their protectors, in late January.\nIn a recent action on gang crime in east China's Zhejiang Province, more than 5,000 police officers were mobilized to arrest over 1,200 suspects, seizing about 250 guns and knives.\nIMPROVE PUBLIC POLITICAL AND LEGAL SERVICES\nProviding better public services and protecting public interests are other key topics concerning the country's political and legal officials.\nThe procurator-general said

analyst and an expert on the U.S. political issues based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\nJamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident, who was a journalist for The Washington Post, was reportedly assassinated inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.\nThe Saudi government has since been facing increasing pressure to disclose the perpetrators behind the murder of Khashoggi, as well as to end its war

commercial district of Indonesia\u2019s capital listen intently as a man roars into a microphone: \u201cAre you ready to change our president?\nAre you ready for new leadership?\u201d\nBut this is not a political rally.\nDressed in white robes and a turban, Novel Bamukmin of the Jakarta chapter of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), a hardline Islamist group, addresses evening prayers in a mosque.\nAs a year of local and then national elections begins this week in the world\u2019s biggest Muslim-majority country, some Islamic leaders have emerged as the most vocal opponents of President Joko Widodo, who is expected to seek a second term next year.\nThey belong to a loose grouping of Islamists behind protests that culminated in the election defeat and jailing for blasphemy in 2017 of Jakarta\u2019s ethnic-Chinese and Christian governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, a Widodo ally.\nThe case of Purnama, who had said political rivals were deceiving people by using a verse in the Koran to say Muslims should not be led by a non-Muslim, showed how Islam had crept into politics in the officially secular country.\nWidodo has pledged to protect Indonesia\u2019s tradition of pluralism and moderate Islam, and he has banned Hizb ut-Tahrir, a hardline group with ambitions for an Islamic caliphate.\nBut a senior government official conceded there are limits to how much the government can control political messaging in mosques.\n\u201cAny action against this phenomenon is blasted as anti-Muslim so our actions are restricted,\u201d said the official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\u2018CHANGE THE PRESIDENT\u2019\nA former furniture maker and Indonesia\u2019s first president from outside the political and military elite, Widodo - known as Jokowi - has remained popular since he took office in 2014.\nHe is widely seen as an honest man of the people, rare for a leader in a country where the political class is scorned as corrupt and aloof, and his push for infrastructure and cutting red tape has burnished his image as a hands-on leader.\nA recent opinion poll gave him a double-digit lead over the opposition Gerindra party\u2019s Prabowo Subianto, a retired general who is expected to run a second time against Widodo in 2019.\nOpponents and hardline Muslim groups, including the FPI, accuse Widodo of failing to stem income inequality or deliver higher growth, but the most incendiary attacks have often been around religion and ethnicity.\nFalse accusations have spread on social media that the president is not actually Muslim and is a descendant of ethnic Chinese communists.\nWidodo has sought to strengthen his ties with moderate Islamic leaders and he recently appointed a controversial hardline cleric as a communications adviser.\n\u201cThe only way for the opposition to win is to debunk the argument that Jokowi is one of the masses, and to attack his weakest spot, which is his shyness in showing his religion,\u201d said Achmad Sukarsono, a political analyst at Control Risks.\nAhead of local elections across much of the country on Wednesday, the anti-Widodo sentiment has crystallized into a movement called \u201c#GantiPresiden2019\u201d or \u201cChange the president in 2019\u201d.\nThe movement\u2019s founder, Mardani Ali Sera, a member of parliament from a conservative Islamic party, says he has no connection with political messaging in mosques.\nBut he says the majority of those affiliated with his movement are from Islamic parties and the groups that opposed Jakarta\u2019s Christian governor.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t use mosques but if the hashtag and the movement works for you, then go ahead and use it,\u201d Sera, who is active on social media, told Reuters.\nThe FPI\u2019s Bamukmin supports the #GantiPresiden2019 movement and said he and other preachers push that message in sermons.\n\u201cIt is the duty of Muslims to try and replace the current president who has betrayed the country and his religion,\u201d he said, accusing Widodo of \u201cselling the country to foreigners\u201d and \u201cempowering communists and deviant religious sects\u201d.\nNO CAMPAIGNING ALLOWED\nIndonesia\u2019s election laws prohibit political campaigning in places of worship ahead of polls.\nVice President Jusuf Kalla told media political discussion is allowed in mosques because they are places of education as well as worship, but campaigning is not.\nThe government can do little to stop such activity in mosques, said a spokesman for the religious affairs ministry.\n\u201cIf there are clerics who use mosques for political interests, it\u2019s better that the public itself persuades them to stop.\nIt is not in the ministry\u2019s capacity to identify or stop them,\u201d said Mastuki, who goes by one name.\nTens of millions of Indonesians will vote in 171 elections for mayors, regents, and governors on Wednesday, an important barometer ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections in 2019.\nOpinion polls suggest candidates backed by parties supporting Widodo will win in many parts of Java, Indonesia\u2019s most populous island, but

million asylum seekers arrived in Germany in 2015, the country's initial reaction was summed up by its veteran chancellor Angela Merkel in three words: \"We can do it!\"\nAnd Merkel reiterated whenever questioned about the challenges that the influx of refugees would create.\nThree years later, Merkel's fourth governing cabinet has moved away from what became known as the \"open door policy\" in September 2015.\nThe federal government has now swerved decisively to the right on migration, a move that was underscored by a recent compromise reached to resolve bitter infighting over asylum policy between the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Christian Social Union (CSU) conservative sister party and coalition partner.\nCDU-CSU SPAT OVER ASYLUM POLICY\nFollowing the publication of his ambitiously-named \"migration master plan\" in June, interior minister and CSU leader Horst Seehofer threatened to resign unless Merkel endorsed the complete document or found a comparable solution on a European level within the course of two weeks.\nMost controversially, Seehofer wanted to refuse asylum access to German territory if migrants had formally entered the Schengen zone via another country.\nThe ultimatum imposed by Seehofer on the chancellor marked a historically unprecedented show of cabinet disobedience in Germany, which threatened to unravel the entire ruling grand coalition.\nAt least initially, Merkel was critical of the \"migration master plan.\"\nShe warned of a potential domino effect in the European free travel area caused by its unilateral border control provisions, as neighboring states rush to shutter their internal Schengen borders in response.\nYet instead of sacking the rebellious minister, the chancellor hurried to a meeting in Brussels, where she managed to secure a vague agreement from Germany's European partners to toughen and expand their joint asylum policies.\nUpon return to Berlin, she then struck a deal with Seehofer to resolve the CDU-CSU spat by establishing \"transit centers\" on German-Austrian borders, where asylum seekers who are already registered in the European Union (EU) will be detained before being transferred on to the responsible member state.\nThe outcome raised eyebrows in European capitals, with many observers arguing that the negotiated agreement was much closer to Seehofer's \"master plan\" for a strict and national asylum regime than Merkel's vision of European solidarity around the issue.\nHARDENING STANCE ON MIGRATION\nThe hardening of Berlin's stance on migration was also seen to have occurred with peculiar timing, in light of official data that pointed to a steady decline of new asylum applications and related pressures in Germany since 2015.\nThe latest step taken by the interior ministry towards the implementation of the \"migration master plan\" is a case in point.\nThe interior minister recently announced that the Spanish government had offered to take back asylum seekers from Germany who were already registered in Spain.\nResponding to a query by Handelsblatt newspaper, Seehofer's ministry admitted, however, that not a single individual would have been affected by the bilateral agreement during the past two months.\nMadrid's offer to help prevent so-called \"secondary migration\" of asylum seekers within the Schengen free-travel area specifically applies to individuals who are intercepted at the German-Austrian border.\nAlthough eight asylum seekers who were pre-registered in Spain were registered in Germany during the past two months, none of them had entered the country from Austria.\nGiven the geographic location of Spain in the far West of Europe, it is highly unlikely that refugees and other irregular migrants will take a detour to Germany via its South-Eastern neighbor Austria.\nThe data was thus seen by critics of the deal, and Seehofer's politics more generally, as evidence that the CSU leader is unnecessarily stoking popular fears with anti-immigrant symbolism.\nAccording to the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), the number of first-time asylum applications in Germany has plummeted from 722,370 applications in 2016 to 198,327 applications in 2017.\nThe German Federal Criminal Police Office's (BKA) further reported that overall criminal offences declined by 9.6 percent from 2016 to 2017, contrary to suggestions by some that the mass arrival of refugees in the country would unleash a national crime wave.\nSpeaking to Xinhua, Kai Unzicker, a senior project manager at the Bertelsmann Foundation, argued that as once predicted by Merkel, Germany had in fact coped well under the pressure of the \"refugee crisis.\"\n\"Cities and communities have achieved enormous successes in collaboration with an active and open civil society.\"\nUnzicker readily admitted that \"housing and catering for such a large amount of people on such notice was logistically and financially challenging.\"\nNevertheless, the situation \"relaxed again\" quickly as of 2016, when the number of new arrivals began to drop.\nAs a consequence, Unzicker argued that the federal government's harsher rhetoric on asylum owed more to psychological and political factors than any significant deterioration in citizens' quality of life.\n\"Racist and xenophobic appearances and stances have poisoned the public debate in Germany.\nEven though crime and unemployment rates are at all-time lows, fear and insecurity are being promoted,\" he warned.\nCHANGING PUBLIC ATTITUDES AHEAD OF ELECTIONS\nA visible sign of changing popular attitudes was found in a poll in July, in which the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party overtook the German Social Democrats (SPD) as the country's second largest party.\nIn turn, the SPD publicly attacked the CSU for damaging the reputation of the government by attempting to \"drag it to the right-wing spectrum of politics.\"\nThat the CSU is attempting to change its tune may reflect the party's growing desperation ahead of looming regional elections in its Bavarian homestead.\nPolls suggest that the CSU is set to lose its long-standing legislative majority in the state, as the AfD attracts growing numbers of voters who feel disenfranchised by what they view as an aloof political elite.\nIn spite of the AfD's evident momentum, Robert Vehrkamp, senior advisor at the Bertelsmann Foundation, argued that the CDU and CSU would both benefit politically from a consensus on abstaining from copying the language and rhetoric of right-wing populists.\nVehrkamp also cautioned that centrist parties risked legitimizing populist adversaries if they simply copied their strategies.\nSo far, the CSU's efforts to ward off a challenge from the AfD do appear to have born little fruit.\nIn an opinion survey published by Deutsche Welle shortly after the CDU and CSU reached their compromise on asylum, Seehofer's approval rating plummeted by 16 percent to 27 percent.\nBy contrast, Merkel only witnessed a slight monthly drop in her reading to 48 percent (minus two percentage points).\nWhen it comes to the chancellor, it

President Jalal Talabani announced Monday that they plan to introduce a proposal that would allow thousands more former members of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party to serve in the government.\nThe plan, if it were to gain approval, would be an important step toward reconciling Iraq's warring Shiites, who lead the government now, and Sunnis, who dominated the Hussein government.\nThe announcement by the prime minister's office came just hours after the outgoing American ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, gave his final news conference in which he repeatedly emphasized that the Iraqi government's slowness to change the draconian de-Baathification laws, among others, had contributed to American skepticism about Iraq's commitment to finding a political solution to the sectarian strife troubling the country.\nThe lack of movement had also hampered efforts at reconciliation between the Sunnis and Shiites, he said, since the Sunnis have had little faith that the Shiite government would do anything concrete to help them.\nChanging the de-Baathification laws was one of the political goals for the Iraqi government set by the Bush administration six months ago.\nUnder the proposal by the prime minister and the president, which comes on the heels of meetings held between Mr. Maliki and Sunni insurgent leaders and appears to be an effort to back up his outreach with action, all Baathists would be able to collect their pensions.\nIn addition, thousands more former Baathists would be allowed to hold government jobs than under the current law.\nFormer Baathists who return to government work would have to sign a pledge that they would refrain from making political statements about the current government.\nThe law would also set a three-month time limit for Iraqi citizens who have complaints against former Baathists to bring a claim.\nThen the courts would have six months to rule.\nAny claims brought subsequently would be thrown out.\nThe goal of the new law is to take a step toward reconciling Sunnis and Shiites, said Dr. Sadiq al-Raqadi, a political adviser to Mr. Maliki.\n\"The reason for the new law is that the government wants to finish these cases; they want to close the files of the Baathists,\" he said.\n\"This is an effort to find a solution for the problem of the Baathists.\"\nThe Iraqi government's move, one of several aspects of reconciliation, comes not a moment too soon in Mr. Khalilzad's view.\n\"To sustain U.S. support, things have to move at a certain pace,\" Mr. Khalilzad said.\nAnd, time is running out, he said.\nThe

more former members of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party to serve in the government.", "The plan, if it were to gain approval, would be an important step toward reconciling Iraq's warring Shiites, who lead the government now, and Sunnis, who dominated the Hussein government.", "The announcement by the prime minister's office came just hours after the outgoing American ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, gave his final news conference in which he repeatedly emphasized that the Iraqi government's slowness to change the draconian de-Baathification laws, among others, had contributed to American skepticism about Iraq's commitment to finding a political solution to the sectarian strife troubling the country.", "The lack of movement had also hampered efforts at reconciliation between the Sunnis and Shiites, he said, since the Sunnis have had little faith that the Shiite government would do anything concrete to help them.", "Changing the de-Baathification laws was one of the political goals for the Iraqi government set by the Bush administration six months ago.", "Under the proposal by the prime minister and the president, which comes on the heels of meetings held between Mr. Maliki and Sunni insurgent leaders and appears to be an effort to back up his outreach with action, all Baathists would be able to collect their pensions.", "In addition, thousands more former Baathists would be allowed to hold government jobs than under the current law.", "Former Baathists who return to government work would have to sign a pledge that they would refrain from making political statements about the current government.", "The law would also set a three-month time limit for Iraqi citizens who have complaints against former Baathists to bring a claim.", "Then the courts would have six months to rule.", "Any claims brought subsequently would be thrown out.", "The goal of the new law is to take a step toward reconciling Sunnis and Shiites, said Dr. Sadiq al-Raqadi, a political adviser to Mr. Maliki.", "\"The reason for the new law is that the government wants to finish these cases; they want to close the files of the Baathists,\" he said.", "\"This is an effort to find a solution for the problem of the Baathists.\"", "The Iraqi government's move, one of several aspects of reconciliation, comes not a moment too soon in Mr. Khalilzad's view.", "\"To sustain U.S. support, things have to move at a certain pace,\" Mr. Khalilzad said.", "And, time is running out, he said.", "The United States House of Representatives voted last week to begin

Miers, the former White House counsel.\nThe president has offered to allow the aides to sit for private interviews with Congress if the sessions are not transcribed or conducted under oath.\nMr. Graham, Mr. Hagel and Mr. Specter said the interviews should at least be transcribed for the sake of accuracy and transparency.\nOn Sunday, the White House found its strongest Republican defender in a onetime adversary, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican whip.\nIn an interview on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Mr. Lott mocked the Democrats for charging that politics were involved in decisions involving political appointees.\n\"The horrors of horrors -- my goodness,\" Mr. Lott said.\n\"How were they selected in the first place?\"\nMr. Lott also defended Mr. Bush's decision to invoke executive privilege in refusing to provide his aides for sworn testimony before Congress, saying \"he'd be making a huge mistake\" if he decided otherwise.\nLater Sunday, the Democratic National Committee provided a list of quotations from Mr. Lott criticizing former President Bill Clinton for invoking executive privilege during the investigation into his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, including one in 1998 in which Mr. Lott called it improper and said, \"It looks like they are hiding something.\"\nAlso on Sunday, in an interview on \"Late Edition\" on CNN, Senator Orrin G.

Vrije University (VU) in Amsterdam.\nMIGRATION POLICY ROW REIGNITED\nAccording to Crum, the political debate currently evolving in Germany, where the violent clashes in the city of Chemnitz reignited a row over migration policy, could be seen along this new line of conflict.\n\"The political debate in Germany is actually a fight over Angela Merkel's legacy, and it remains to be seen how German politics will evolve after the Chancellor concludes her term in office in some four years,\" the political expert told Xinhua, noting that \"what happens in Germany is essential to the EU.\"\nViolent right-wing protests broke out in Chemnitz late in August, in the eastern German state of Saxony, following the killing of a German man for which two immigrants from Syria and Iraq were arrested.\nThe clashes have deeply shaken German politics, reviving strains in German Chancellor's Angela Merkel's government and sparking an intense debate about Merkel's open border 2015 policy to let in more than a million refugees.\n\"In German politics a lot depends on how Merkel's Christian Democrats and their allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU), succeed in becoming a stable alliance again, managing to win back voters they lost in last September's elections to far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD),\" said Mark Elchardus, Emeritus professor of sociology at the Vrij University of Brussels (VUB).\nAngela Merkel's government faced its deepest crisis since she became chancellor, when a dispute on migration policy between her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its ally, the Christian Social Union (CSU) broke out in June.\nAnti-immigration sentiment, which according to Elchardus is on the rise across the EU despite a sharp drop in the actual number of migrants arriving to the European Union to pre-2015 level, holds a key role in the emerging line of conflict between nationalists and cosmopolitans in Europe.\n\"Today the migration crisis is more about how people react to new arrivals and not about how to actually manage the number of those reaching the EU,\" said Elchardus.\nThe rate at which migrants are arriving has dropped sharply in Europe since the huge inflows in 2015.\nAccording to latest data available by Frontex, the EU's border and coast guard agency, in the first eight months of 2018 the number of irregular border crossings into the EU fell 40 per cent from a year ago to about 86 500.\nIn 2015 more than one million refugees and migrants crossed into Europe.\nORBAN VS MACRON\n\"On the European scene the emerging extremes of the nationalist position versus the cosmopolitan one are best embodied by Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orban on one side and by French president Emmanuel Macron on the other,\" said Crum.\n\"Europe looks very much a struggle between what Macron stands for and what Orban stands for,\" agreed Elchardus, noting that it is unclear how this battle for influence will evolve, especially in regards to party alliance making in the run-up to European Parliament (EP) elections in May 2019.\n\"The opposition between them is very clear, Macron stands for liberal democracy, he is pro-European, whereas Orban advocates illiberal democracy, he is Eurosceptic and against immigration, but it is completely unclear how this is going to translate in alliances within the European parliament,\" the sociologist said.\nMacron framed next year's European elections as a strong opposition \"between nationalists and progressives\" late in August, following statements by Italy's far-right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini and Orban, who labelled the French president their number one enemy.\nCritical to further developments is whether Orban's Fidesz party remains within the conservative European People's Party (EPP), currently the largest grouping in the European Parliament.\n\"It is doubtful whether Orban's party will remain in the EPP,\" said Crum, noting that \"it will be more natural to either be boosted out or to be moved to a more right-wing nationalist group within the EP.\"\nOrban said in June he would prefer Fidesz to stay within the EPP and try to reform the group from the inside, but EPP members, including Merkel's Christian Democrats, have criticized some of Orban's policies.\nMacron's strategy for the European elections is decisive on how the balance of political powers along the conflict of nationalists versus cosmopolitans will evolve within the EU.\n\"Macron has not affiliated himself to any of the European political families and hasn't attempted to create his own group either,\" said Crum.\nMoreover, big questions loom over Europe's Social Democrats.\n\"The decline of social democracy and the inability of those parties to regain their initiative, is an important factor because they have the potential of stopping the rise of far-right, anti-immigration forces,\" said Elchardus.\nWhile Europe has seen a rise in support for far-right, anti-immigrant parties in recent national and regional elections, social democrats have experienced a sharp drop in popularity in several countries across the Continent, underlined by recent developments in Sweden.\nIn last week's national elections in the Nordic country the Social Democrats' vote share fell to its lowest level since 1911, while the anti-immigration nationalists Sweden Democrats made gains.\nElchardus anticipated

McRaven, commander of Special Operations Command Europe, speaking last month at his headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\"They are already somewhat regional and growing.\"\nUnited States Special Operations forces are helping train troops in North Africa to combat the threat.\nIn December and January, Tunisian security forces killed 12 Islamic extremists and captured 15 after uncovering a cell whose leaders had come from Algeria.\nThe Moroccan authorities are hunting as many as 10 would-be suicide bombers after three men blew themselves up on Tuesday.\nA fourth man wearing explosives was killed before he could detonate them.\nOne policeman was killed in the blasts.\nThe men were being sought in connection with an explosion on March 11 in an Internet cafe in Casablanca in which another Islamic extremist blew himself up.\nMany terrorism experts say they suspect that those men are also linked to the Algerian group.\nAttacks in Algeria have steadily increased since December, when a convoy of foreign construction workers was bombed outside the capital.\nIn February, the group claimed responsibility for detonating seven powerful car bombs outside police stations in six towns east of Algiers, killing six people.\nThose coordinated attacks alarmed officials because they involved more sophisticated remote detonation devices.\nLast month, a convoy of oil workers was attacked in Ain Defla Province, west of Algiers, killing one Russian and three Ukrainians.\nSubsequent clashes with the Algerian Army killed nine soldiers and four fighters from Al Qaeda, Algerian officials said.\nThe bombings on Wednesday confirmed fears that the violence would again enter the capital, which became a battleground during the horrific civil war that began in 1992 after the Algerian military canceled elections because an Islamist party was poised to win.\n\"Although we know there are still terrorists outside of Algiers, we didn't believe they were capable of making this kind of attack so near the government headquarters,\" said Mahmoud Belhimeur, a senior editor of El Khabar, Algeria's largest-circulation Arabic newspaper.\nThe attacks began at around 10:45 a.m., when a suicide bomber drove an explosives-packed vehicle through the gate at the building housing the prime minister's office.\nThe bomb tore apart the front of the six-story building, shattered windows in nearby ministries and set several cars in the vicinity on fire.\nWitnesses reported seeing rescue teams remove at least seven badly burned bodies from the rubble.\n\"It was shocking, incredible,\" said Leila Benhamoud, who was at the scene shortly after the blasts.\n\"Even in the park nearby, they found a burned body in the grass.\"\nA second blast destroyed a police station in Bab Ezzouar, an eastern suburb.\nAl Jazeera's bureau in Rabat, Morocco, reported that it had received a telephone call from a spokesman for Al Qaeda claiming responsibility for both attacks.\nThe caller said that the blasts were carried out by three Qaeda members driving trucks filled with explosives, and that the bombers had focused on three sites, including the government headquarters, in Algiers, the Interpol office in Algiers and a building housing the special police forces in Bab Ezzouar, Al Jazeera said.\nHowever, there was no report of an attack at Interpol's Algiers offices.\n\"We won't rest until every inch of Islamic land is liberated from foreign forces,\" the caller said in a recording of the phone call broadcast on Al Jazeera and carried on its Web site.\nHe also called for the release of \"oppressed prisoners in Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania and elsewhere.\"\nPictures of the three men said to have carried out Wednesday's attacks were posted on an Islamist Web site, according to the SITE Institute, a United States group that monitors militants' messages.\nIn the photos, each man was shown wearing a green turban with automatic rifles propped on the wall on each side of him.\nThe men were identified as Muadh bin Jabal, Al Zubair Abu Sajda and Abu Dajjana.\nMr. Sajda and Mr. bin Jabal were wearing suicide vests.\nAl Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb is divided into nine commands, each in charge of a geographic zone.\nAttacks in Zone II, which covers Algiers, are believed to be carried out under the command of Sadouai Abdelhamid, known as Yahia Abu el- Haithem, who was sentenced in absentia last month to 20 years in jail.\nThe attacks follow a period of intensifying military action against the group in which one of its top leaders, Soheib Abu Abdul Rahman, was recently reported to have been killed.\nThat the bombing occurred on the 11th of the month brings to mind the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States and the March 11, 2004, bombings in Madrid, and some terrorism experts suggested that the attacks added to the accumulating symbolism of that day of the month.\n\"I would say that numerology plays a large part,\" said Magnus Ranstorp, a terrorism expert at the Swedish National Defense College in Stockholm.\n\"But the bigger issue is that you have May elections in both Algeria and Paris.\"\nFrench counterterrorism officials are particularly worried about Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb because of the difficulty in monitoring traffic between Algeria, a former colony, and France.\nLast year, the group singled out France as a

thousands of American troops are pouring into Baghdad.\nYesterday the Pentagon announced that battle-weary Army units in Iraq would have to stay on for an additional three months past their scheduled return dates.\nMr. Bush is desperately gambling that by stretching the Army to the absolute limits of its deployable strength, he may be able to impose some relative calm in the capital.\nAnd he seems to imagine that should that gamble succeed, the Shiite-dominated government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki will, without any serious pressure from Washington, take the steps toward sharing political power and economic resources it has tenaciously resisted since the day it took office a year ago.\nUnless Mr. Maliki takes those steps -- eliminating militia and death squad members from the Iraqi Army and police, fairly sharing oil revenues, and rolling back laws that deny political and economic opportunities to the Sunni middle class -- no lasting security gains are possible.\nMore Iraqi and American lives will be sacrificed.\nEven among Shiites, who suffered so much at the hands of Saddam Hussein and who are the supposed beneficiaries of Mr. Maliki's shortsighted policies, there is a deep disillusionment and anger.\nThis week, a Washington Post reporter interviewed Khadim al-Jubouri, who four years ago swung his sledgehammer to help knock down the dictator's statue.\nMr. Jubouri said that ever since he watched that statue being built he had nourished a dream of bringing it down and ushering in much better times.\nNow, with friends and relatives killed, kidnapped or driven from their homes, the prices of basic necessities soaring and electricity rationed to four hours a day, Mr. Jubouri says the change of regimes \"achieved nothing\" and he has come to hate the American military presence he once welcomed.\nMr. Maliki's supporters can be even more frightening to listen to.\nThis week's demonstration in Najaf was organized by the fiercely anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, whose political party and militia helped put Mr. Maliki in power and are still among his most important allies.\nTwo months into the Baghdad security drive, the gains Mr. Bush is banking on have not materialized.\nMore American soldiers continue to arrive, and their commanders are talking about extending the troop buildup through the fall or into early next year.\nAfter four years, the political trend is even more discouraging.\nThere is no possible triumph in Iraq and very little hope left.", "output_sentences": ["Four years ago this week, as

Calder\u00f3n ran last summer on a promise to create jobs, but in his first five weeks as chief executive he has made it clear his first priority is to turn his government into the scourge of organized crime.\nThe president has sent thousands of federal police and troops into the drug-plagued states of Michoac\u00e1n and Baja California to break up criminal organizations and stop the brutal violence they perpetuate.\nThe federal forces have burned marijuana crops, arrested suspected drug gang members and disarmed local police forces the authorities say are crippled by corruption.\n\"We will continue with the operations that let us re-establish the minimum conditions of security in some parts of the republic, so that little by little we can take back our streets, our parks, our schools,\" Mr. Calder\u00f3n said in a New Year's message to the nation.\nBut some opposition politicians and experts on the drug trade wonder if the federal interventions are not more flash than substance, and question if they will have a lasting impact on the drug trade and police corruption, whose roots run deep.\nMr. Calder\u00f3n's predecessor, Vicente Fox, created an elite force to combat narcotics dealers and arrested dozens of drug cartel leaders during his six-year term.\nRather than stanch the violence, however, the arrests led to a brutal war between the remaining traffickers for the smuggling routes and territory.\nIn the southwestern state of Michoac\u00e1n, where more than 500 people were killed last year, the violence has persisted despite the president's decision to send in more than 7,000 officers and soldiers last month.\nDrug dealers killed about 21 people during the last three weeks of December, according to local news reports.\nThis week, a mass grave was found with seven bodies bearing signs of gangland executions, and a 12-year-old boy was executed in what appeared to be a drug dispute.\nStill, Mr. Calder\u00f3n made a rare appearance dressed in military fatigues on Wednesday to congratulate troops in Michoac\u00e1n and to tout their successes.\nFour top members of the Valencia drug gang were arrested and hundreds of acres of marijuana were burned, the authorities said.\nIn Tijuana on Tuesday, Mr. Calder\u00f3n ordered 2,600 soldiers and 110 federal police officers to begin an operation aimed at ending the grip of mobsters on the local police department, slowing the flow of drugs and ending kidnappings and killings related to the trade.\nThe officers began patrolling the streets with caravans of pickups filled with heavily armed officers in black combat outfits.\nThe army set up roadblocks, while navy boats prowled the coast and helicopters buzzed overhead.\nSoldiers in camouflage uniforms pulled over cars at random and searched them.\nFederal and state police manned checkpoints in the town.\nThe federal government also stripped all 2,320 city police officers of their weapons on Wednesday night.\nThe move prompted fears that anarchy would break out in the city streets, where drunken brawls, car thefts, muggings and drug-induced mayhem are a daily fact of life.\nThe city secretary of public security, Luis Javier Algorri, said Friday morning there were too few federal officers to keep order, much less ferret out drug gangs at the same time.\n\"We think they don't have the experience to deal with these sorts of problems,\" Mr. Algorri said.\n\"And without firearms this kind of work will be hard to carry out.\"\nThe decision to disarm the local police reflects the belief among federal officials that many local officers are on the payroll of drug cartels as assassins, enforcers and, in some cases, kidnappers.\nFederal prosecutors say the lack of help from the local police in border towns, either because they are corrupt or afraid, makes it nearly impossible to dismantle drug cartels.\nThe mayor of Tijuana, Jorge Hank Rhon, said he welcomed the intervention.\nHe did not dispute that a significant number of police officers were corrupt, saying their salaries are so low that drug lords can easily bribe them.\n\"It's not the police,\" he said.\n\"It's some policemen.\"\nMany residents said they were tired of finding victims of mob executions in the streets in the mornings, as well as the wave of kidnappings that has rocked this border town over the last 12 months.\nLast year there were more than 300 killings in the city, most of them linked to drug gangs, including 25 police officers, authorities said.\nIn interviews, most residents said they welcomed the crackdown, even as some expressed skepticism the caravan-style patrols and roadblocks would do much to hurt drug traffickers.\nDavid L\u00f3pez, a 28-year-old importer, watched Wednesday night as about 25 federal policemen in full combat uniforms and carrying machine guns pulled over an expensive pickup truck outside a downtown nightclub.\nIt seemed to him a showy waste to use a small army of officers to make a traffic stop.\nTijuana has always been a major corridor for drug smugglers because it is one of the busiest border crossings in the country.\nSince the 1990s, the infamous Arellano F\u00e9lix family

the equivalent of 27,000 Olympic swimming pools of water.\nIf Colombo were to lose all its wetlands, flooding would shave off about 1 percent of its annual gross domestic product of some $53 billion, according to a World Bank study.\nProjections by the bank and the government show that without the wetlands, major floods like the one in 2010 \u2013 which rose as high as 5 meters (16 ft) in some areas -

powerful storms in U.S. history, with winds of up to 155 mph (250 kph).\nIt pushed a wall of seawater inland, causing widespread flooding.\nThe tropical storm, which grew in less than two days into a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, tore apart entire neighborhoods in the Panhandle, reducing homes to naked concrete foundations or piles of wood and siding.\nExcept for the

weeks before power is restored to the most damaged parts of Florida.\nThe numbers in emergency shelters were expected to swell to 20,000 across five states by Friday, said Brad Kieserman of the American Red Cross.\nThe Coast Guard said it rescued 129 people.\nEven as rescuers searched the rubble for survivors or the dead, some Mexico Beach residents were nervously trickling back, expressing

Blodgett, the \u00c2Essex district attorney, said the decision clarified legal and procedural questions around the special drug lab sessions, reducing the chances of further litigation.\n\"Our overriding concern was the possibility of relitigating Dookhan drug lab cases for a third time,\" he said in a statement.\n\"This would have stretched the already limited \u00c2resources of all the district attorney\u2019s offices.\"\nMichael O\u2019Keefe, district \u00c2attorney for the Cape and \u00c2Islands, said the decision would help prosecutors handle the host of legal challenges arising from the scandal, which officials have estimated could affect well over 100,000 cases.\n\"As district attorneys, our goal is to expedite the cases as quickly as possible,\" said O\u2019Keefe, president of the state association of district attorneys.\n\"In that \u00c2regard, it\u2019s helpful to know what the rules are.\"\nIn a separate section of the ruling, the court said that special magistrates who were appointed by the Superior Court to preside over the drug lab sessions are not authorized to stay a sentence.\nBut the magistrates, who by March had conducted more than 900

of so-called Dookhan defendants who are seeking new trials, upholding the legal framework created to review hundreds of cases tied to the state drug lab scandal.", "In a decision issued Monday, the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that the \"exceptional circumstances\u2019' surrounding convictions tied to Annie Dookhan, the former state chemist who allegedly falsified suspected drug samples, gave Superior Court judges the power to free defendants who are challenging their convictions.", "\"The allegations of mis\u00c2conduct at the Hinton drug lab have given rise to serious concerns about defendants who may be incarcerated as a consequence of tainted convictions,\" the ruling stated.", "\"Thus, a defendant\u2019s motion to stay the execution of his sentence should be decided in an expeditious manner.\"", "While largely procedural, the decision highlighted the swirl of legal questions surrounding Dookhan-related cases, which have flooded the judicial system and led to the release of hundreds of defendants, more than 300 from state prisons and more from county facilities.", "Last fall, Essex County prosecutors contested motions to stay sentences in more than 50 cases involving allegedly tainted drug evidence, contending that the judge lacked the authority to stay sentences in the absence of a pending appeal.", "The court disagreed, saying \"the interest of justice is not served by the continued imprisonment of a defendant who may be entitled to a new trial.\"", "\"The magnitude of the allegations of serious and far-reaching misconduct by Dookhan at the Hinton drug lab cannot be overstated,\" the ruling stated.", "\"The alleged misconduct may have compromised thousands of \u00c2cases.\"", "Dookhan faces a host of criminal charges related to mis\u00c2handling or falsifying drug evidence.", "She has pleaded not guilty.", "Matthew Segal, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said the decision marked a \"complete \u00c2rejection\u2019' of prosecutors\u2019 attempt to challenge the system set up to handle the Dookhan cases.", "\"It said the exact procedure being used is fine,\" he said.", "The court went a step further, Segal said, in indicating that Dookhan\u2019s involvement in cases may be enough to warrant a new trial.", "\"My hope is that courts will look at this opinion and see reasons for granting new trials,\" he said.", "\"You can\u2019t rest a conviction on fraud.\"", "Jonathan W. Blodgett, the \u00c2Essex district attorney, said the decision clarified legal and procedural questions around the special drug lab sessions, reducing the chances of further litigation.", "\"Our overriding concern was the possibility of relitigating Dookhan drug lab cases for a third time,\" he said in a statement.", "\"This would have stretched the already limited \u00c2resources of all the district attorney\u2019s offices.\"", "Michael O\u2019Keefe, district \u00c2attorney for the Cape and \u00c2Islands, said the decision would help prosecutors handle the host of legal challenges arising from the scandal, which officials have estimated could affect well over 100,000 cases.", "\"As district attorneys, our goal is to expedite the cases as quickly as possible,\" said O\u2019Keefe, president of the state association of district attorneys.", "\"In that \u00c2regard, it\u2019s helpful to know what the rules are.\"", "In a separate section of the ruling, the court said that special magistrates who were appointed by the Superior Court to preside over the drug lab sessions are not authorized to stay a sentence.", "But the magistrates, who by March had conducted more than 900 hearings on Dookhan-related cases, can make \"conclusions of law\u2019' for judges to review, as they have been doing.", "The court also ruled that magistrates cannot overrule a Superior Court judge\u2019s decision to stay a sentence.", "Anne Goldbach, forensic services director in the state public defender\u2019s office, said the decision upholds the status quo.", "\"It says that the process set up to handle these cases is a valid one,\" she said.", "The court\u2019s decision focused on a case involving a Lynn man, Shubar Charles, who in 2010 pleaded guilty to cocaine possession with intent to distribute.", "He was sentenced to four to seven years in state prison.", "Last December, he filed a \u00c2motion to stay the execution of his sentence, noting that Dookhan was the primary chemist on the case.", "The motion was granted, and prosecutors \u00c2appealed.", "A second case involved \u00c2Hector Milette, who in 2011 pleaded guilty to cocaine trafficking.", "In November, a judge \u00c2denied his motion for a stayed sentence, but a special magistrate overturned the decision in February.", "Prosecutors appealed, and he was sent back into custody.", "He later pleaded guilty, admitting the substance was cocaine despite Dookhan\u2019s involvement, prosecutors said."], "discourse": [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4]}

rare scheduled commercial flights out of Tallahassee, which is often impractical.\nIn today\u2019s Florida, the only elected official who gets to fly is the one who can afford it.\nEverywhere Scott

Bloomberg has taken the rare step of filing a lawsuit against the city comptroller, John C. Liu, for rejecting two municipal contracts.\nThe contracts would pay Aguila Inc., a company run by Robert V. Hess, Bloomberg\u2019s former commissioner of homeless services, a total of $67.6 million to operate homeless shelters in the Bronx and Manhattan.\nThe Manhattan shelters have long been a target of criticism from local residents and elected officials, who say, among other complaints, that the area has an excess of similar facilities.\nLiu rejected the contracts on July 3, saying they were too vague as to how many people would be offered services.\nAnd in a criticism of Bloomberg\u2019s record on homelessness, Liu argued that \u201cit would be unconscionable to compound past errors with these faulty contracts.\u201d\nBut Bloomberg, in a lawsuit filed Thursday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, said the courts had long held that registration of contracts was \u201cnot a vehicle for the comptroller to usurp the mayor\u2019s authority to enter into contracts.\u201d\nThe lawsuit, believed to be only the second filed by the Bloomberg administration against the city or state comptroller\u2019s office, is the latest and perhaps most pronounced skirmish between Bloomberg and Liu, a Democrat who is now running for mayor.\nAdministration officials contend that there is a discrepancy between the reasons Liu cites in his news releases for rejecting a contract and the public documents explaining the reasons.\nLiu, the city contends, typically asks for more technical information, then registers those contracts with few if any changes and no public notification.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a joke,\u201d Marc La Vorgna, Bloomberg\u2019s press secretary, said of Liu.\n\u201cSad part is this is taxpayer resources and dollars being completely wasted on naked political ambitions.\nHe was running for mayor the second he stepped into this job and had no interest in doing the job he was sworn in to do, only to abuse the position.\u201d\nAides to Liu argue that the comptroller needs to highlight certain Bloomberg proposals because the mayor has mishandled contracts, like those for the CityTime payroll project and for an overhaul of the 911 system.\n\u201cUnder Mayor Bloomberg, spending on outside contractors has ballooned, and his outsourcing philosophy is out of control,\u201d said Stephanie Hoo, a spokeswoman for the comptroller.\n\u201cIn all cases, whenever this office has questioned contracts, it has been within the guidelines of the City Charter and our mandate to protect taxpayers from wasteful spending.\u201d\nIn the rare cases where a mayor or a comptroller sues the other over contracts, the courts have held that comptrollers have extremely limited powers.\nIn 2006, the Court of Appeals rejected former Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr.'s effort to void a contract on Snapple, writing that \u201cthe Charter establishes in plain language that the mayor and the corporation counsel - not the comptroller - bear the burden of determining that procedural requirements have been met and legal authority exists to award a concession contract.\u201d (Thompson ran against Bloomberg in 2009 and is again seeking the Democratic nomination for mayor.)\nUnder the charter, the only basis for a comptroller to scuttle a contract is evidence of possible corruption in the contracting process.\nIn rejecting the shelter contracts, Liu mentioned not corruption, but concerns over inspections and certificates of occupancy.\nBloomberg administration officials cited more than a half-dozen instances in recent years in which Liu publicized a rejection of a contract, then quietly registered it.\nIn March 2011, for example, Liu rejected a $20 million deal on teacher recruitment, saying the timing was \u201ccurious at best\u201d because of Bloomberg\u2019s threat to fire teachers.\nBut the reasons for rejecting the contract pertained to data input and an incomplete insurance certificate.\nLiu registered the contract that July, with minimal changes.\nWhen asked about the discrepancies between press statements and public documents, Hoo did not directly address the issue, but rather alluded to the mayor\u2019s maneuver to run for a third term in 2009.\n\u201cIt is beyond ironic that Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s Law Department is up in arms about adherence to the City Charter when no one in the history of New York City has shown such deep disrespect for the City Charter,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIf we\u2019d followed the charter, he wouldn\u2019t even be in office right now.\u201d", "output_sentences": ["NEW YORK - Fed up with what he views as a pattern of obstructionist behavior, Mayor Michael R.

Hess, Bloomberg\u2019s former commissioner of homeless services, a total of $67.6 million to operate homeless shelters in the Bronx and Manhattan.", "The Manhattan shelters have long been a target of criticism from local residents and elected officials, who say, among other complaints, that the area has an excess of similar facilities.", "Liu rejected the contracts on July 3, saying they were too vague as to how many people would be offered services.", "And in a criticism of Bloomberg\u2019s record on homelessness, Liu argued that \u201cit would be unconscionable to compound past errors with these faulty contracts.\u201d", "But Bloomberg, in a lawsuit filed Thursday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, said the courts had long held that registration of contracts was \u201cnot a vehicle for the comptroller to usurp the mayor\u2019s authority to enter into contracts.\u201d", "The lawsuit, believed to be only the second filed by the Bloomberg administration against the city or state comptroller\u2019s office, is the latest and perhaps most pronounced skirmish between Bloomberg and Liu, a Democrat who is now running for mayor.", "Administration officials contend that there is a discrepancy between the reasons Liu cites in his news releases for rejecting a contract and the public documents explaining the reasons.", "Liu, the city contends, typically asks for more technical information, then registers those contracts with few if any changes and no public notification.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a joke,\u201d Marc La Vorgna, Bloomberg\u2019s press secretary, said of Liu.", "\u201cSad part is this is taxpayer resources and dollars being completely wasted on naked political ambitions.", "He was running for mayor the second he stepped into this job and had no interest in doing the job he was sworn in to do, only to abuse the position.\u201d", "Aides to Liu argue that the comptroller needs to highlight certain Bloomberg proposals because the mayor has mishandled contracts, like those for the CityTime payroll project and for an overhaul of the 911 system.", "\u201cUnder Mayor Bloomberg, spending on outside contractors has ballooned, and his outsourcing philosophy is out of control,\u201d said Stephanie Hoo, a spokeswoman for the comptroller.", "\u201cIn all cases, whenever this office has questioned contracts, it has been within the guidelines of the City Charter and our mandate to protect taxpayers from wasteful spending.\u201d", "In the rare cases where a mayor or a comptroller sues the other over contracts, the courts have held that comptrollers have extremely limited powers.", "In 2006, the Court of Appeals rejected former Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr.'s effort to void a contract on Snapple, writing that \u201cthe Charter establishes in plain language that the mayor and the corporation counsel - not the comptroller - bear the burden of determining that procedural requirements have been met and legal authority exists to award a concession contract.\u201d (Thompson ran against Bloomberg in 2009 and is again seeking the Democratic nomination for mayor.)", "Under the charter, the only basis for a comptroller to scuttle a contract is evidence of possible corruption in the contracting process.", "In rejecting the shelter contracts, Liu mentioned not corruption, but concerns over inspections and certificates of occupancy.", "Bloomberg administration officials cited more than a half-dozen instances in recent years in which Liu publicized a rejection of a contract, then quietly registered it.", "In March 2011, for example, Liu rejected a $20 million deal on teacher recruitment, saying the timing was \u201ccurious at best\u201d because of Bloomberg\u2019s threat to fire teachers.", "But the reasons for rejecting the contract pertained to data input and an incomplete insurance certificate.", "Liu registered the contract that July, with minimal changes.", "When asked about the discrepancies between press statements and public documents, Hoo did not directly address the issue, but rather alluded to the mayor\u2019s maneuver to run for a third term in 2009.", "\u201cIt is beyond ironic that Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s Law Department is up in arms about adherence to the City Charter when no one in the history of New York City has shown such deep disrespect for the City Charter,\u201d she said.", "\u201cIf we\u2019d followed the charter, he wouldn\u2019t even be in office right now.\u201d"], "discourse": [0, 3, 6, 2, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6]}
