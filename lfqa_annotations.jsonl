One theory is that, when the solar system formed from gas and space dust particles, the space dust formed clumps that became planets.

One last theory is that the giant planets had the mass and gravity to form miniature solar-system-like disks around themselves and pull in passing objects as irregular moons to form an eccentric ring instead of a system of moons with stable orbits. Smaller planets nearer to the sun were made up of less material and had less space dust around them, so they formed moons through collisions that broke chunks off the planets and sent them into orbit.","random_indice":[0,1],"gpt_scores":[7.0,5.0],"gpt_scores_unshuffled":[7.0,5.0]}

The United States likes to try to control areas with instability, because gaining footholds increases their scope, influence, and power. During the cold war, the United States was incredibly concerned about the influence of communism over the rest of the world, because it is at odds with capitalism and the United States way of life. The Soviet Union's brand of totalitarianism just didn't fit with the United State's brand of totalitarianism. After the U.S. \"won\" the cold war, the Russian bear went dormant and struggled to find itself and it's place in world domination. Now-a-days, the bear is trying to spread its wings, and this challenges the domination the United States has over the rest of the world. Unstable Middle Eastern and African regions are supposed to be controlled by the United States, and any intrusion into that control is going to be met with hostility. So in summary, it's basically about the U.S. controlling the world, and having that control challenged. Areas of instability are areas of economic opportunity for the United States, both government and corporate entities. If the United States can establish a dominant presence in a region, they can sell military equipment, and McDonald's to the fledgling beta powers in those regions. Russia getting involved in Syria is like Burger King getting their shit together and putting out a decent burger, and promoting the hell out of it. They're bombing the people that are like the United State's McDonalds marketers. The U.S. wants McDonald's to seize control of the airwaves from the evil Taco Bell, but Russia is challenging that air time with their own marketers.

The last limit arises from the fact that the crucifixion was considered to have happened on the 14th ( the eve of the Passover ) and the resurrection therefore on the sixteenth . The schematic model that eventually was accepted is the Metonic cycle , which equates 19 tropical years to 235 synodic months . The `` computus '' is the procedure of determining the first Sunday after the first ecclesiastical full moon falling on or after 21 March , and the difficulty arose from doing this over the span of centuries without accurate means of measuring the precise tropical year . The vernal equinox is fixed to fall on 21 March ( previously it varied in different areas and in some areas Easter was allowed to fall before the equinox ) . However , the vernal equinox and the full moon are not determined by astronomical observation . The full moon is an ecclesiastical full moon determined by reference to a lunar calendar , which again varied in different areas . For most of their history Christians have calculated Easter independently of the Jewish calendar .","random_indice":[1,0],"gpt_scores":[7.0,6.0],"gpt_scores_unshuffled":[6.0,7.0]}

I feel he couldn't produce enough investors at a point to which he turned to price gouging for sufficient funding. Overall I feel anyone can be a CEO you just have to know people and recruit. Most people only seem to focus on the fact that they need to produce the funds to build a business when all you really need to do is prove to a rich person why they should invest with you and boom you can make any company you want.

Injecting into a vein, therefore, is going to deliver the drug to the brain in a high concentration within seconds, with the resulting \"rush\" that IV heroin users are chasing. A lot of long-time heroin users have scarred up their veins so much that they have to resort to \"skin popping\", which is basically SC or sometimes a more superficial \"intradermal\" injection. The result is often necrosis (death) of the affected tissue, pain, swelling, and compartment syndrome, which can cut off blood supply to the affected extremity and lead to amputations. This often leads to awful skin and soft tissue infections and abscesses. When it comes to recreational drugs like heroin, the intensity of the \"high\" is relative to how fast the drug gets into the brain. If you miss the vein, the heroin is probably going IM or SC, so it will get into the bloodstream, and the brain, more slowly, with a less intense high.","random_indice":[0,1],"gpt_scores":[8.0,5.0],"gpt_scores_unshuffled":[8.0,5.0]}

Higher ceilings allow more time for smoke and heat to accumulate before affecting things closer to the floor (e.g., people, fire load\/combustibles). The height also can allow for fire suppression systems that cover a greater area with fewer components, such as sprinkler heads. In addition, it is generally easier to control the climate in a larger space with larger air volumes (exchanges per hour) that are not as noticeable in one spot. (Except for those annoying freeze-or-fry areas where air flows are concentrated.) The air handlers in these systems can also be configured for use following a fire to assist in evacuating smoke from a building, either by exhaust or pressurizing the building (negative and positive pressure ventilation, respectively). Construction costs would tend to be slightly higher because of the longer (higher) columns required, which in turn need to be stronger because of (typically) larger roof systems such as bar joists or trusses. Such costs can be somewhat offset by reducing the number of columns required.

This is somewhat true of all the tastes, but adding salt will balance out a dish and not let one taste overpower the others.  Thirdly, it's been shown to increase that aromatic effects of many types of food.

Why can't Microsoft Office save or open files that have slashes or colons in their names?","q_id":"nycui","a_id":"c3cxu7q","output":"In addition and like others have said, file names are limitations of the file system. The file system is like the drawer that holds the files. The drawer has sections and each section can only fit a certain kind of file. A legal sized file won't fit in a drawer that holds letter sized documents. As a holdover from the days of the beginnings of Windows, many filename characters are not permitted such as  <  > ?!: etc., that is because the file system is not equipped to handle those types. Using Microsoft Office on a Mac, you could save all kinds of filenames, save for those with a colon. This is because Classic Mac OS uses colons to separate files. The newer Mac OS uses colons at the basic system level, so it is reserved.
