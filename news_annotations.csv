Generate a news article for the following headline.,White House Gears Up to Sell Plan for Troop Increase in Iraq,"The White House is planning an aggressive effort to sell Congress and the American public on President Bush's new strategy for Iraq, beginning with a prime-time address to the nation on Wednesday night, followed Thursday by a presidential trip to Fort Benning, Ga., and appearances on Capitol Hill by the secretaries of state and defense.
With Democrats vowing to oppose any plan to send more troops to Iraq, and some Republicans openly skeptical, Mr. Bush and his aides are already in the thick of an intense sales pitch.
It began on Monday, when the president had back-to-back meetings with Republican senators, urging them to hear him out before passing judgment on his plan.
The sessions stood in stark contrast to the bipartisan meetings Mr. Bush held with lawmakers on Friday.
Senators attending those sessions said that Mr. Bush was careful not to reveal his thinking about whether he was committed to the plan to increase troops.
By Monday, though, he made his intentions clear.
""It was clear that he has thought long and hard about this change in strategy,"" said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who supports the troop increase.
""He emphasized that this is not just about more troops.
That's just one small component of it.
It's a change in economic, military and political strategy.""
White House officials were still planning details of the speech on Monday.
The president's aides were contemplating having Mr. Bush deliver it from the White House Map Room, a site replete with the history and imagery of World War II -- imagery that Mr. Bush has invoked as he has sought to compare the campaign against terrorism to the struggle against totalitarianism and the Nazis.
But the Oval Office, a more traditional setting, was also being considered.
Mr. Bush's aides are planning a highly orchestrated introduction of the plan.
Before Wednesday night's speech, which is expected to last about 25 minutes, reporters will receive briefings from senior administration officials, and leading members of Congress will be notified of the president's intentions.
On Thursday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates are scheduled to testify before Congress, and both are expected to make trips to the Middle East soon to drum up support from international allies.
""All the world is really watching,"" the White House press secretary, Tony Snow, said Monday, ""and it is important to get this right.""
The president himself will go on the road on Thursday, to Fort Benning, a site chosen because its soldiers are heavily involved in operations in Iraq.
A senior administration official involved in shaping the strategy said the president would follow Wednesday night's speech with less formal remarks to the troops.
""He will thank them, and explain, just like he will have the night before to the American people, some of the specifics of the new way forward,"" the official said.
The official said the strategy also included continuing consultation with members of Congress.
""It's not just one speech,"" the official said.
""This is so complicated you couldn't do it all in one speech.
So there will be an ongoing and sustained effort to educate the American people.""
Despite Mr. Bush's insistence that he does not govern by polls, the White House is acutely aware that a vast majority of the American public disapproves of the job Mr. Bush is doing in Iraq.
But advisers to the president believe that the public is willing to give Mr. Bush another chance -- especially if he puts forth a policy that is heavy on specifics.
The president's advisers are also mindful of polls showing that while the public wants the situation to improve in Iraq, it does not necessarily favor immediate withdrawal.
""They're going to cast it as a choice between withdrawal and surge,"" said one Republican strategist close to the White House.
""The public is not for immediate withdrawal or even a quick withdrawal, but they're not for the status quo.
I think they feel as if the public is more likely to support the president's position, which is putting a stake in the ground in Iraq and saying were going to try to win.""
The hope is that Mr. Bush can win over the public, and bring Congress along.
But it might be a tough sell.
At the White House, Mr. Bush told skeptical senators that he came away from a recent meeting in Jordan with Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq persuaded that Mr. Maliki was committed to moving toward national reconciliation.
At least two Republicans, Senators Gordon Smith of Oregon and Olympia Snowe of Maine, said they were not convinced.
""I expressed reservations,"" Ms. Snowe said.
""I said, 'Why should we expect any different result than previously,' that I didn't believe the Maliki government had demonstrated the political will or capacity or resoluteness for reconciliation, that the reason Americans are not supporting the war is because they see Iraqis fighting among themselves rather than for themselves, and I didn't see the surge addressing the root causes of the violence.""
Mr. Smith, who delivered a speech on the Senate floor before Christmas saying he was at the end of his rope on Iraq, said: ""What this sets up is a classic war powers confrontation between the White House and the Congress.
Clearly he has the powers to commit troops; the question is whether the Congress has the convictions to deny funding.""
The senator said he, for one, does not have the appetite for that.
""It would be a dishonorable thing,"" he said, ""to budget away the bullets.""","[""The White House is planning an aggressive effort to sell Congress and the American public on President Bush's new strategy for Iraq, beginning with a prime-time address to the nation on Wednesday night, followed Thursday by a presidential trip to Fort Benning, Ga., and appearances on Capitol Hill by the secretaries of state and defense.""

The hope is that Mr. Bush can win over the public, and bring Congress along. ""The public is not for immediate withdrawal or even a quick withdrawal, but they're not for the status quo.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Bank's tight grip on cash is ill-advised,"A strict diet, designed for medical purposes, is just part of the deal.
That includes hiding the salt shaker and steering clear of alcohol.
Smoking is out of the question, and frequenting the gym whenever your body is agreeable would also qualify as part of the routine.
When you are waiting on a kidney transplant to prolong your life, you accept certain hassles along the way.
Ronald Yaffe expected all of that.
Here’s what he did not expect:
A yearlong battle with Wells Fargo concerning $10,000 in cashier’s checks from the 1980s that the bank says it is not obligated to pay.
""I’m mad.
This has gotten personal, and I’m not going to let it go,"" Yaffe said Monday.
""Who would ever think that if you give your money to a bank, they won’t give it back to you when you ask for it?""
This story begins more than 30 years ago when Yaffe began turning his spare cash into cashier’s checks at Central Fidelity Bank in Richmond, Va., where he was an optometrist.
The idea, he said, was to have emergency funds to take with him on long sailing trips.
The checks, totaling $11,800, went unused and Yaffe stashed them in a safe deposit box when he retired to Sarasota a short time later.
With his medical condition worsening and a transplant or dialysis likely, Yaffe, 73, retrieved the checks last year, figuring his prescription costs would soon skyrocket.
He deposited the funds in an account, but Wells Fargo soon notified him that the checks were invalid.
The bank, Yaffe said, told him they could not find the necessary paper trail.
Central Fidelity was sold to Wachovia in 1998, and Wachovia was acquired by Wells Fargo in 2009.
The Virginia Department of Treasury found a record for one of the checks in unclaimed funds and sent Yaffe $1,800.
The agency said the other $10,000 was reclaimed by Central Fidelity in 1987, according to Sarasota’s Herald-Tribune, which originally reported the story.
That’s when Yaffe took the matter to court, and won a judgment last month for the $10,000 plus interest accrued from the time he tried to deposit the checks.
Wells Fargo has since filed an appeal, saying Florida law has a five-year statute of limitations on cashier’s checks.
""We are abiding by the law,"" said Wells Fargo spokeswoman Kathy Harrison.
""The judge in this case elected to ignore the case law that supports it.
It’s an unfortunate situation, and now that it’s in litigation, there is not much more we can do or say.""
Today’s cashier’s checks typically carry disclaimers saying they will be voided if not cashed in a specified period of time, often 90 days or six months.
Yaffe said there were no time limits written on his checks in 1982.
Even if the judgment is upheld in appeals, Yaffe says a portion of the $10,000 will go to attorney fees.
And so a sick man might lose a large chunk of money, and a bank risks looking greedy and coldhearted.
At this point Wells Fargo would be justified if it was worried about setting a legal precedent, but a little compassion a year ago could have avoided the whole mess.","['A strict diet, designed for medical purposes, is just part of the deal.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Facebook runs into lawsuit over Cambodian politics,"Former Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy has filed a legal case in the United States to get Facebook to release information on Prime Minister Hun Sen’s use of the social media platform, his legal team said.
Lawyers for Sam Rainsy, who fled Cambodia in 2015 to escape a conviction for defamation he says was politically motivated, said he sought the information to help him in his own legal cases in Cambodia.
Supporters of Hun Sen have built a strong presence on Facebook.
Sam Rainsy wants information on allegations of “false likes” on Hun Sen’s Facebook account, accusations that the platform had been used to make death threats and the use of state money for advertisements, his legal team said in a statement on Wednesday.
Government spokesman Phay Siphan said the lawsuit was “not useful”.
The case highlights the growing global nature of the challenge to Facebook Inc over its role in political debate after accusations that social media was used for meddling in votes in Britain, the United States and elsewhere.
Facebook has become an ever more important platform for political news in Cambodia as some media outlets critical of Hun Sen have been forced to shut.
Hun Sen, 65, has been criticized by Western countries over a ban on the main opposition party and the arrest of its leader less than a year away from a general election on July 29.
Paris-based Sam Rainsy sought “critical information in Facebook’s possession regarding Hun Sen’s misuse of social media to deceive Cambodia’s electorate and to commit human rights abuses,” according to the statement.
“The petition raises fundamental questions about how Facebook should deal with human rights abusers who manipulate elections,” said Sam Rainsy’s attorney, Richard J. Rogers, of rights group Global Diligence LLP.
Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case, which Sam Rainsy’s lawyers said had been brought in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
Hun Sen’s Facebook profile was private, the Cambodian government spokesman added.
“The Facebook profile of the Samdech Prime Minister is private, it’s not a terrorist group to cause any insecurity with any country,” said Phay Siphan, using the official title for Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for more than 33 years.
Facebook, which has more than 2 billion users globally, tells advertisers they have the potential to reach 6.6 million people in Cambodia, from a population of nearly 16 million.
It says more than 5.5 million people have expressed an interest in, or liked, pages related to Hun Sen, of whom 1.8 million are in Cambodia.
Comparable figures for Sam Rainsy are 2.2 million people expressing an interest, with 1.7 million within Cambodia.","['Former Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy has filed a legal case in the United States to get Facebook to release information on Prime Minister Hun Sen’s use of the social media platform, his legal team said.'

Paris-based Sam Rainsy sought “critical information in Facebook’s possession regarding Hun Sen’s misuse of social media to deceive Cambodia’s electorate and to commit human rights abuses,” according to the statement. “The petition raises fundamental questions about how Facebook should deal with human rights abusers who manipulate elections,” said Sam Rainsy’s attorney, Richard J. Rogers, of rights group Global Diligence LLP. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case, which Sam Rainsy’s lawyers said had been brought in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Hun Sen’s Facebook profile was private, the Cambodian government spokesman added. “The Facebook profile of the Samdech Prime Minister is private, it’s not a terrorist group to cause any insecurity with any country,” said Phay Siphan, using the official title for Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for more than 33 years. Facebook, which has more than 2 billion users globally, tells advertisers they have the potential to reach 6.6 million people in Cambodia, from a population of nearly 16 million. It says more than 5.5 million people have expressed an interest in, or liked, pages related to Hun Sen, of whom 1.8 million are in Cambodia. Comparable figures for Sam Rainsy are 2.2 million people expressing an interest, with 1.7 million within Cambodia.","['Hun Sen, 65, has been criticized by Western countries over a ban on the main opposition party and the arrest of its leader less than a year away from a general election on July 29.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Offshore wind firm Orsted expands U.S. business with $510 million acquisition,"Orsted (ORSTED.CO), the world’s largest offshore wind developer, said on Monday it would buy U.S.-based Deepwater Wind LLC for $510 million as part of its strategy to expand in a major growth market.
The still small U.S. offshore wind sector is seen as one of the most important markets outside the core European region, where subsidies that have underpinned the industry since the early 1990s are starting to be wound back.
Deepwater Wind, the builder of the only operating U.S. offshore wind farm, has a portfolio with a capacity of around 3.3 gigawatts (GW).
Orsted’s U.S portfolio currently has a capacity of 5.5 GW.
Orsted has so far lost out on auctions in the nascent market, while Deepwater Wind has been more successful and currently has the right to develop wind farms in Rhode Island, New York and Connecticut.
“With this transaction we’re creating the number one offshore wind platform in North America,” Orsted’s offshore wind chief Martin Neubert in a statement.
The drive to open America’s offshore wind industry has attracted Europe’s biggest renewable energy companies, who see the U.S. East Coast as a new frontier after years of success across the Atlantic.
Orsted said the acquisition increased its capital expenditure guidance to 23-25 billion Danish crowns ($3.55-3.86 billion) this year from previous guidance of 16-18 billion.
The new guidance includes the acquisition price of Deepwater Wind, early capex commitments for the U.S. business in the fourth quarter, “as well as increased spending in the remaining portfolio due to timing”.
Orsted also recently acquired U.S. onshore wind developer Lincoln Clean Energy.","['Orsted (ORSTED.CO), the world’s largest offshore wind developer, said on Monday it would buy U.S.-based Deepwater Wind LLC for $510 million as part of its strategy to expand in a major growth market.'

Orsted said the acquisition increased its capital expenditure guidance to 23-25 billion Danish crowns ($3.55-3.86 billion) this year from previous guidance of 16-18 billion. The new guidance includes the acquisition price of Deepwater Wind, early capex commitments for the U.S. business in the fourth quarter, “as well as increased spending in the remaining portfolio due to timing”. Orsted also recently acquired U.S. onshore wind developer Lincoln Clean Energy.","The still small U.S. offshore wind sector is seen as one of the most important markets outside the core European region, where subsidies that have underpinned the industry since the early 1990s are starting to be wound back. Orsted (ORSTED.CO), the world’s largest offshore wind developer, said on Monday it would buy U.S.-based Deepwater Wind LLC for $510 million as part of its strategy to expand in a major growth market. Orsted’s U.S portfolio currently has a capacity of 5.5 GW. Deepwater Wind, the builder of the only operating U.S. offshore wind farm, has a portfolio with a capacity of around 3.3 gigawatts (GW).

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"2017 ""costliest"" year in U.S. with weather, climate disasters: gov't report","Last year will be remembered as the ""costliest"" one for the United States with losses from hurricanes, fires and freezes reaching a record 306 billion U.S. dollars, a U.S. government report said Monday.
The United States had 16 weather and climate disasters in 2017 each with losses exceeding one billion dollars, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in its report.
That ties 2011 for the record number of billion-dollar disasters for an entire calendar year, but the total cost shatters the previous U.S. annual record of 214.8 billion dollars in 2005, the agency said.
At least 362 people died and many more were injured during the course of the disasters that included one drought event, two flooding events, one freeze event, eight severe storm events, three tropical cyclone events, and one wildfire event, it said.
Among the disasters are the western U.S. wildfires that caused damages tallying 18 billion dollars, which was triple the previous U.S. record, said the report.
Losses from Hurricane Harvey, which caused massive flooding in Texas, exceeded 125 billion dollars, which ranked second only to Hurricane Katrina, the costliest storm in the 38-year period of record.
Hurricanes Maria and Irma had total damages of 90 billion dollars and 50 billion dollars, respectively.
Hurricane Maria now ranks as third costliest weather and climate disaster on record for the nation, with Irma coming in close behind as fifth costliest, it said.
""Since 1980, the U.S. has sustained 219 weather and climate disasters that have exceeded 1.5 trillion dollars in overall damages to date,"" the U.S. agency wrote.
""The 1980-2017 annual average is 5.8 events; the annual average for the most recent five years (2013-2017) is 11.6 events.""

""This was the third warmest year since record keeping began in 1895, behind 2012 (55.3 degrees Fahrenheit) and 2016 (54.9 degrees Fahrenheit), and the 21st consecutive warmer-than-average year for the U.S. (1997 through 2017),"" the report said.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Sweden seeks way out of political gridlock after far-right gains,"Swedish political parties face weeks of haggling to form a government after voters delivered a hung parliament on Sunday, with the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats saying they hold the balance of power.
A preliminary allocation of parliamentary seats gave the center-left bloc - uniting the minority governing Social Democrat and Green parties with the Left Party - 144 seats versus 143 for the center-right Alliance bloc.
The Sweden Democrats, who want to leave the European Union, won 62 seats, up from 49 in the 349-seat Riksdag where 175 seats are needed to form a majority.
Doing a deal with them would give either bloc a majority but the mainstream parties have ruled out cooperating with a party which has roots in the white supremacist fringe.
Both blocs have declared themselves victors in the election, but need additional support to form a viable government without the Sweden Democrats, who want influence over immigration policy.
There are a number of ways out of the tangle.
CENTER-RIGHT MINORITY RULE
The Alliance of the Moderates, Centre, Liberals and Christian Democrats looks set to be slightly smaller than the center-left.
But it will hope for backing from the Sweden Democrats to oust Prime Minister Stefan Lofven and to install Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson as his replacement.
However, a formal agreement with the Sweden Democrats would very likely see the Centre and Liberal parties, who want looser immigration policies, jump ship.
It is not clear whether the Centre and Liberal parties would take part in a government that had no formal support from the Sweden Democrats but in practice relied on their votes to install a prime minister.
On Monday, Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Akesson invited the Moderates and Christian Democrats to formal negotiations but was quickly rebuffed.
Akesson said his party would vote against any government that did not give it a say in policy.
SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND GREENS CLING ON
The Social Democrats and Greens could retain power in the unlikely event that Prime Minister Lofven survives a mandatory vote on whether to replace him.
Lofven said he would remain in office in the coming weeks and called for cooperation across the political divide.
When voting for a prime minister in parliament, a proposal is passed unless a majority of all 349 lawmakers vote against.
This has allowed minority governments to rule.
The Alliance would need the Sweden Democrats to back a vote to oust Lofven and install Kristersson.
A GRAND COALITION
The Alliance could join a grand coalition with the Social Democrats and possibly the Greens to exclude the Sweden Democrats.
The Left Party, Sweden’s former Communist party, would also be left out.
But the Moderates - the biggest party in the Alliance - are not interested in cooperating with the Social Democrats and such a deal would also raise questions about democratic accountability.
Voters might see the Sweden Democrats as the country’s only opposition party.
MODERATE ONE-PARTY RULE
The Moderates could form a one-party government but that would require support from the Sweden Democrats as well as the smaller center-right parties.
Moderate leader Kristersson has ruled this out, and the Centre and Liberal parties would probably not go along with the idea if the Sweden Democrats were given any significant say over policy while remaining outside the government.
NEW VOTE
Parliament opens on Sept. 25.
If Lofven is ousted, the speaker is allowed to give a maximum of four prime ministerial candidates the opportunity to form a government.
If they all fail, fresh elections must be called.
There is no formal time limit for negotiations, but the deadline for the budget is Nov. 15.
If no new government is in place by then, the current government, continuing as caretakers, would put forward a budget until a new cabinet can take office.","['Swedish political parties face weeks of haggling to form a government after voters delivered a hung parliament on Sunday, with the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats saying they hold the balance of power.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,SECOND OPPOSITION LEADER ASSASSINATED IN TUNISIA,"TUNIS, Tunisia - Tunisia, birthplace of the Arab Spring revolutionary movement, was plunged into a new political crisis Thursday when assassins shot an opposition party leader outside his home in a hail of gunfire.
It was the second political assassination in Tunisia since February, and quickly incited protests blaming Ennahda, the moderate Islamist party that leads the government.
Crowds of protesters gathered outside the offices of the Interior Ministry in Tunis, the capital, calling on Ennahda to relinquish power, and security forces were deployed to contain them.
The Associated Press reported that protests erupted in other cities, including Sidi Bouzid, the impoverished town where the Tunisian revolution began, and in the nearby town of Meknassi, where angry demonstrators burned down the local Ennahda headquarters.
Ennahda issued a statement calling the assassination “cowardly and despicable.” The leader of Ennahda, Rachid al-Ghannouchi, said on Tunisian radio: “This is a crime against the democratic transition of Tunisia.
The classic question is: Who is behind this?
I don’t think that any political party would want this.”
TAP, Tunisia’s official news agency, said the victim was Mohamed Brahmi.
Brahmi, 58, leader of the Arab nationalist People’s Party, was felled by several bullets outside his residence in Ariana, a suburb of Tunis.
Other local Tunisian media said a pair of gunmen had shot Brahmi at least 11 times as he sat in a car with his daughter and that the killers escaped on a moped.
At a hospital where Brahmi’s body was taken, dozens of protesters gathered to denounce Ennahda.
“Ghannouchi is an assassin!” said a woman draped in a Tunisian flag.
Others shouted: “The Islamists are vampires!”
Noomen Toumi, one of the protesters at the hospital, said he believed Islamist extremists might have been behind the assassination of Brahmi.
“It has to be someone who is against democracy,” he said.
The assassination, which coincided with celebrations for the 56th anniversary of Tunisian statehood after independence from France, came as Tunisia was still grappling with a democratic transition following the January 2011 revolution that toppled the country’s autocratic leader, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, and forced him into exile.
The Tunisian revolution was the catalyst that spawned similar uprisings in Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Syria.
The top human rights official at the United Nations, Navi Pillay, expressed shock at the killing of Brahmi and urged “the authorities to immediately launch a prompt and transparent investigation to ensure that the people who carried out this crime are held accountable.”","['TUNIS, Tunisia - Tunisia, birthplace of the Arab Spring revolutionary movement, was plunged into a new political crisis Thursday when assassins shot an opposition party leader outside his home in a hail of gunfire.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Amazon India denies it gives select sellers preferential treatment,"Amazon’s Indian business has denied accusations that it favors select merchants and brands, responding to a complaint lodged by an Indian lobby group.
The All India Online Vendors Association (AIOVA) on Friday filed a petition with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) alleging that the online retailer favors merchants that it partly owns, such as Cloudtail and Appario.
The company said on Monday that all sellers on its platform are treated equally.
“Amazon has an equal relationship with all the sellers on our marketplace,” Amazon India spokeswoman Bhumika Shah said in an email, adding that the company is “absolutely committed” to compliance with local laws.
AIOVA, which represents more than 3,500 online sellers, said that large sellers such as Cloudtail and Appario were being charged significantly less than Amazon’s advertised rates.
Cloudtail is owned by Prione Business Services, which is a joint venture between Amazon and Infosys co-founder N.R Narayana Murthy’s Catamaran Ventures.
Appario is a joint venture between Amazon and Patni group.
“There should not be any preferential treatment,” AIOVA’s lawyer, Chanakya Basa, said on Monday.
India has a burgeoning e-commerce market, with almost 500 million Indians using the Internet in 2018 and the e-commerce market is tipped to grow to $200 billion in a decade, according to Morgan Stanley.
AIOVA has asked the antitrust regulator to impose a “severe penalty” for unfair practices and to restrict what it says are “preferred sellers” from participating in Amazon India’s annual festival sales, which start this week.
The lobby group filed a similar petition against Walmart-owned Flipkart in May, alleging violation of competition rules through preferential treatment for select sellers.
AIOVA also asked for restrictions to be placed on Flipkart’s festival sale this week.
Flipkart did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Amazon has scheduled its Great Indian Festival sale over Oct. 10-15 and Flipkart’s Big Billion Days sale is scheduled for Oct. 10-14, according to their websites.","['Amazon’s Indian business has denied accusations that it favors select merchants and brands, responding to a complaint lodged by an Indian lobby group.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"IN the five years since the last farm bill was passed, the number of farmers' markets in this country has grown to nearly 4,500 from 2,750, gladdening the hearts of foodies who like nothing better than seeing locally grown Chioggia beets, butter radishes, Early Girl tomatoes, miniature pattypan squash, chervil, fresh goat cheese logs and duck breast in a conveniently located market.
Some of the best customers of farmers' markets, though, haven't been free-spending foodies, but food-aid recipients.
Happily, the new farm bill before Congress has several proposals to vastly increase food aid to the poor, including two programs that allow them to buy at farmers' markets.
That normally would be great for small farmers.
Without the guaranteed income from the farm bill's $15 million Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program and the separate $25 million Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (part of the food aid program for families known as WIC), some small growers would be out of business, and many others would be reluctant to sell in low-income neighborhoods where fresh produce is otherwise a rarity -- ""food deserts.""
But, it turns out, new efforts to encourage food-aid recipients to eat more fruits and vegetables -- which are calamitously underrepresented in American diets -- could end up shutting out the small farmers who are the backbone of these markets.
The Agriculture Department has proposed rules that would reallocate WIC benefits now restricted to eggs and dairy products, which have long enjoyed the muscle of well-financed lobbies, to fruits and vegetables, which haven't.
Millions of children would be entitled to $6 a month for produce.
And in its initial proposals for the new farm bill, the Bush administration suggested making available $200 million, starting next year, to buy fruits and vegetables for the poor.
If such suggestions get approved, hundreds of millions more dollars could be spent every year on fresh produce.
There's a big catch, though: small farmers might not reap the windfall.
Over the past 15 years, most states have switched from paper coupons for food stamps to debit cards, removing the stigma of redemption at the checkout counter.
The WIC program, which still uses paper, will most likely do the same.
Most farmers, of course, don't take plastic -- and, market managers say, they have seen their sales plummet with the switch from paper.
The need for farmers to enter the cashless economy is obvious.
Wireless card readers will benefit both people on food assistance and foodies who (like me) don't carry all the cash they end up eager to spend.
But who will pay for the machines, which can cost as much as $1,500 and incur steep monthly service fees, not to mention workers trained to use them?
Without card readers, farmers fear they will lose the bulk of the farm bill help they get now, and be shut out of those new hundreds of millions.
The proposals at the Agriculture Department and in the farm bill would let food-aid recipients buy fruits and vegetables wherever they can find them.
That means supermarkets -- which remain the most convenient place to buy produce.
Farmers' market advocates are alarmed.
The money will go to the centralized industrial farms that supply supermarkets, they say -- the ones that crush small farmers and waste fuel.
So: Help small farmers and the places dedicated to selling truly local food, or help the sharply increasing number of people struggling to feed themselves and their families?
The most equitable way to help farmer's markets may be to urge legislators to support good programs already in the farm bill, like the Farmers' Market Promotion Program and Community Food Projects.
These could equip farmers with card readers, an essential first step, and finance other ingenious projects to help small farmers thrive.
Concerned cooks (and everyone else) should urge increases for education programs that tell people how and where to use food stamps.
Only 56 percent of people eligible for food stamps get them, and most of those recipients don't know that the stamps can be used at farmers' markets.
A reason often given for the great success of the WIC farmers' market program is the nutrition education that comes with it.
Yes, supermarkets may well get the great majority of increased benefits for fresh produce.
But a small slice of a much larger pie could amount to as much as or more money than farmers' markets now get from food-assistance programs.
And the new money available for fruit and vegetables would mean that ""specialty crops"" -- the kind we actually think of as food, as opposed to crops like corn, soy and cotton that get the much criticized multibillion-dollar commodity subsidies -- would finally get support from the farm bill.
More people would eat healthier diets, and farmers might start growing even better-tasting varieties, confident of finding a market.
Many other programs proposed for the farm bill could bring locally grown food to places that want and need it, like schools and hospitals.
But farmers' markets are where the bill can best serve cooks -- a frequently well-financed, always opinionated special-interest group that should start acting like one.","[""IN the five years since the last farm bill was passed, the number of farmers' markets in this country has grown to nearly 4,500 from 2,750, gladdening the hearts of foodies who like nothing better than seeing locally grown Chioggia beets, butter radishes, Early Girl tomatoes, miniature pattypan squash, chervil, fresh goat cheese logs and duck breast in a conveniently located market.""

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"Power, phone outages hamper hurricane recovery one week after storm","A week after Hurricane Michael battered Florida’s Gulf Coast with record fury, the full extent of devastation and loss of life remained unclear on Wednesday, as disruptions to phone, power and transportation systems hindered the disaster recovery.
At least 30 people were killed, according to local authorities, when Michael plowed ashore as one of the fiercest hurricanes on record to strike the U.S. mainland, pulverizing a cluster of seaside towns along Florida’s northwestern Panhandle region.
Seven days later search crews continued combing through the wreckage of demolished neighborhoods looking for any sign of additional victims in Panama City Beach, Mexico Beach and Port St. Joe, the communities closest to the storm’s landfall.
Distribution of food and water to storm-stricken residents farther inland has been slowed by communication outages and storm-shattered roads blocked by toppled trees, power lines and other debris.
Florida officials have not said how many people may be missing.
Teams of volunteers with the Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue organization were trying to reach more than 700 Florida residents reported unaccounted for by worried relatives and friends, said Matthew Marchetti, the organization’s co-founder.
Most of that number, down from 2,100 people the group was trying to locate in the immediate aftermath of the storm, are from Panama City and many of them are elderly, disabled, impoverished or living alone, Marchetti said.
He said the search had been hampered by spotty cell phone service in the devastated area, though authorities were making progress in restoring communications.
High volumes of missing persons reports are not uncommon in the days following a natural disaster because so many survivors fail to check in with loved ones right away or lack the means to do so because of phone and power outages, authorities said.
Nevertheless, at least 48,000 Florida residents in the 12 counties hardest hit by Hurricane Michael had registered for disaster assistance as of Wednesday with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA spokesman Ruben Brown told Reuters.
That number represents about 7 percent of the population of the 12 counties designated by President Donald Trump’s federal disaster declaration as eligible for FEMA aid to individuals and households.
Nearly a third, or more than 15,000 people, reported storm damage to their homes when they signed up with FEMA, though the full scope of property losses remained to be seen, Brown said.
As of Wednesday, 286 families left homeless by the storm in Bay County, at the epicenter of the disaster, were approved for FEMA-furnished hotel vouchers, he said.
Florida accounted for 20 of the known fatalities attributed to Hurricane Michael, with six more in Virginia, three in North Carolina and one in Georgia, according to a Reuters tally of reports from county officials along the path of the storm.
Officials said medical examiners were determining whether another four deaths in Florida were storm-related.
As of Tuesday, FEMA had distributed about 4.5 million meals, more than 5 million liters of water and 9 million infant-and-toddler kits, Brown said.
The state government was distributing ice, water and about 3 million ready-to-eat meals, Governor Rick Scott’s office said.
Nearly 155,000 homes and businesses remained without power in the U.S. Southeast, with residents of battered coastal towns forced to cook on fires and barbecue grills.
At least 70 percent of customers in four mainly rural Florida Panhandle counties were without electricity on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, the federal government said that 61.5 percent of cell sites remained out of service in Bay County.
Officials said it could be weeks before power returns to some.
Countless numbers of people in the region’s backcountry have struggled for days without running water or sanitation, awaiting help from authorities.
Some have been camping in tents with the belongings they were able to salvage.","['A week after Hurricane Michael battered Florida’s Gulf Coast with record fury, the full extent of devastation and loss of life remained unclear on Wednesday, as disruptions to phone, power and transportation systems hindered the disaster recovery.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Thyssenkrupp defends landmark split as scepticism mounts,"German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE) on Monday defended a landmark deal to split into two as concerns mounted over whether the plans, which will result in a 1 billion euro ($1.2 billion) tax hit, go far enough.
Last week Thyssenkrupp said it would spin off its elevators, car parts and plant engineering units into a separate listed entity named Thyssenkrupp Industrials, while keeping steel and materials-related activities.
In the first analyst call since the plans were announced, Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff, who was given a five-year contract on Sunday, said the new structure would reduce complexity and give shareholders a more transparent asset to invest in.
Some analysts said however that Thyssenkrupp Industrials, while more focused, would still be a complex entity.
“Ultimately, we’ve gone from one big conglomerate to two smaller conglomerates,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Cedar Ekblom said during the call.
“TK Industrials has got three divisions, which are all capital goods businesses, but ultimately, are very different businesses with very different end-markets.”
Kerkhoff said, however, that the links between the divisions were significant.
“There is some glue between the three,” he said.
“They’re all depending on the same megatrends in the world.
They’re all depending on engineering and service competencies throughout the businesses.”
Shares in the company fell as much as 4.7 percent after the call.
The corporate split came in response to years of shareholder pressure to simplify Thyssenkrupp’s sprawling conglomerate set-up.
Analysts have pointed out that the group still needs a strategy for the business following the structural change.
The split bears similarity to E.ON’s (EONGn.DE) spin-off of Uniper (UN01.DE), in which the German utility kept a minority stake which it said could be sold on the open market.
It was ultimately acquired by Finnish peer Fortum (FORTUM.HE).
In a similar vein, Thyssenkrupp, which will be renamed Thyssenkrupp Materials, will quickly move to sell the minority stake in Thyssenkrupp Industrials it will still hold after the spin-off is complete.
“The sooner the better,” Kerkhoff said, adding that Thyssenkrupp Materials would sell at the highest possible price as soon as the market could absorb it.
The corporate split still requires shareholder approval, which is expected by early 2019.
“Thyssenkrupp Materials is sustainable without the stake in Thyssenkrupp Industrials,” Kerkhoff said.","['German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE) on Monday defended a landmark deal to split into two as concerns mounted over whether the plans, which will result in a 1 billion euro ($1.2 billion) tax hit, go far enough.'

Kerkhoff said, however, that the links between the divisions were significant. “Ultimately, we’ve gone from one big conglomerate to two smaller conglomerates,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Cedar Ekblom said during the call. “TK Industrials has got three divisions, which are all capital goods businesses, but ultimately, are very different businesses with very different end-markets.” They’re all depending on engineering and service competencies throughout the businesses.” “They’re all depending on the same megatrends in the world. Shares in the company fell as much as 4.7 percent after the call. It was ultimately acquired by Finnish peer Fortum (FORTUM.HE). Analysts have pointed out that the group still needs a strategy for the business following the structural change. The split bears similarity to E.ON’s (EONGn.DE) spin-off of Uniper (UN01.DE), in which the German utility kept a minority stake which it said could be sold on the open market. The corporate split came in response to years of shareholder pressure to simplify Thyssenkrupp’s sprawling conglomerate set-up. “The sooner the better,” Kerkhoff said, adding that Thyssenkrupp Materials would sell at the highest possible price as soon as the market could absorb it. The corporate split still requires shareholder approval, which is expected by early 2019. “Thyssenkrupp Materials is sustainable without the stake in Thyssenkrupp Industrials,” Kerkhoff said. In a similar vein, Thyssenkrupp, which will be renamed Thyssenkrupp Materials, will quickly move to sell the minority stake in Thyssenkrupp Industrials it will still hold after the spin-off is complete.","German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE) on Monday defended a landmark deal to split into two as concerns mounted over whether the plans, which will result in a 1 billion euro ($1.2 billion) tax hit, go far enough.

In the first analyst call since the plans were announced, Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff, who was given a five-year contract on Sunday, said the new structure would reduce complexity and give shareholders a more transparent asset to invest in.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Tussle Over Iraq Bill Reminds Many of Bitter 1995,"The parallels are striking: bold new Congressional majorities swept into power by public dissatisfaction with White House policies.
The administration and Congress digging in for a test of wills over federal spending.
A watershed presidential election looming.
Memories of the rancorous 1995 budget fight between President Clinton and leaders of the Republican revolution are casting a distinct shadow over the current impasse between President Bush and Congressional Democrats on Iraq.
Each side believes it can apply lessons learned from that earlier battle to its strategy in the current showdown.
The 1995 budget fight grew out of the push by Republicans -- riding their historic House takeover the year before -- for cuts in federal spending, with Medicare as their poster child for a bloated federal program.
When Mr. Clinton refused to go along with trimming the program, budget talks collapsed, and the resulting 21-day shutdown put nearly 300,000 federal workers on furlough and disrupted public services.
Republicans were outmaneuvered in that battle, and found that the public blamed them for a shutdown of federal agencies.
Today, they stand behind the executive branch, with 150 Republican House members promising Mr. Bush they would sustain his veto of a war spending measure that sets a timeline for leaving Iraq.
Democrats, who sided with the president in 1995, are the ones challenging the White House now, bolstered by public sentiment against the war.
Even as those in the middle of the current clash strategize about the next move, some figures central to the past fight say the differences are more pronounced than the similarities.
""There were no Americans risking their lives at the Washington monument in 1995,"" said Newt Gingrich, the Republican speaker at the time whom critics accused of badly overplaying his hand.
""There were no Americans being shot at the Interior Department in 1995,"" he said.
""We were engaged in a domestic political debate over being serious over a balanced budget.
The Democrats risk sending signals to our enemies that kidnapping British sailors and killing young Americans is acceptable.""
Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader in 1995, sees differences as well, but believes they play to Democratic strengths, with Mr. Bush defending an unpopular war and Democrats treading more carefully than did Mr. Gingrich and his coterie.
""Newt Gingrich boasted of shutting the government down,"" recalled Mr. Daschle.
""He was proud of the fact he was doing that just to show his will.
Republicans felt they had a mandate and could do what they wanted.
I don't think you could find a Democrat who thinks they have a mandate, but we do have a chance.""
Almost from the beginning of the budget fight in 1995, Mr. Clinton's poll numbers edged up and those of Mr. Gingrich, the Republican speaker of the House, dipped as the public perceived the president as the one trying to resolve the problem and Republicans as inflexible.
One difference with 1995 was that in that episode, there was tangible fallout for Americans as parks and museums closed, benefit checks were delayed and an array of federal assistance was suspended.
Today, the administration is making the case that the military will be denied resources, and some tours in Iraq might have to be extended if no bill is approved.
But the Pentagon appears to have the flexibility to pay for operations at least through May and possibly longer with substantial juggling.
Nevertheless, any event detrimental to the troops that could be tied to the impasse could cause a backlash for Democrats.
Republicans say they continue to believe that much of the public still regards the president as the nation's pre-eminent leader and that Congress should not meddle in White House business too deeply.
""With us it was a bridge too far,"" said Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia, recalling the duel with Mr. Clinton.
""Tactically, we made a mistake and found the American people still liked the office of the presidency having some dominance.
This is the Democrats' government shutdown.""
But Democrats say that Mr. Bush is operating in an atmosphere of deep skepticism and that he must fight his own low poll numbers as well as public frustration with the war -- even though a recent survey showed a slight gain in optimism about Iraq.
""We have had a chance to study 1995, and Democrats are bound and determined to make sure it won't happen to them,"" said Jim Manley, a spokesman for Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader.
""Here we have a president seriously at odds with the American people.""
Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the current chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and a senior aide in the Clinton administration, said Mr. Bush was retracing the missteps of Mr. Gingrich, courting conflict, while Mr. Clinton displayed a willingness to compromise.
""President Clinton started off with, 'Come on, let's talk, let's negotiate,' "" said Mr. Emanuel.
""President Bush has started off with confrontation.""
Indeed, the White House has drawn a hard line, saying it will not legitimize a Democratic withdrawal plan of any sort by accepting it as part of legislation.
Two Democrats said that Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, urged Mr. Bush to work with Democrats on the war while the two mingled in her office before a Capitol Rotunda ceremony last week; the Democrats said that Mr. Bush's reply was essentially, ""I am where I am.""
Both sides are trying to exploit openings.
Republicans, aware of Mr. Bush's low standing, point to the added domestic spending in the House and Senate bills, trying to build resentment to pork-barrel projects.
The White House is employing its presidential megaphone, particularly with Congress out of town for Easter.
Mr. Bush took to the Rose Garden on Tuesday to warn of ""significant consequences for our men and women in the armed forces.""
Democrats immediately fired back, accusing the president of being out of touch with the public and calling on him to negotiate.
""I saw a lot of what happened when my husband had a Republican Congress,"" said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, as she toured Iowa as part of her presidential campaign.
""We would stake out one position, they would stake out one position.
And then people would begin to try to figure out how to narrow the difference.
That's what should be happening here.""
It is difficult to predict who will prevail.
After all, no one foresaw in the fall of 1995 that a simple legislative dispute would end up stalling the momentum of a determined new majority and enhancing the standing of an embattled president.","['The parallels are striking: bold new Congressional majorities swept into power by public dissatisfaction with White House policies.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,MOUNTAINOUS ROOFTOP ADDITION DRAWS NOTICE IN BEIJING,"BEIJING - In a city brimming with look-at-me architecture, the sprawling addition that Zhang Biqing, a health care magnate, built atop his 26th-floor apartment is a showstopper.
Constructed with ersatz boulders, crisscrossed by trellises and walkways and dotted with the occasional shrub, the two-story aerie resembles the idealized mountains depicted in classical Chinese paintings - except the requisite lonely monk of yore has been replaced by a flashy karaoke parlor.
The entire 8,000-square-foot addition, as it turns out, is illegal.
On Monday, The Beijing Morning News featured a front-page photograph of Zhang’s garish rooftop expansion, along with disturbing accounts of how the well-connected entrepreneur blithely ignored his neighbors’ complaints during the six years he spent creating his craggy villa atop a luxury gated complex in western Beijing.
Tenants were so tortured by the din of nonstop construction - and the resulting leaks and cracked walls - that several of them sold their apartments and moved out.
One next-door neighbor was reportedly beaten up after he confronted Zhang about the project, which is said to have cost more than $4 million.
The story, zealously covered by much of the Chinese news media on Tuesday, seemed to embody the popular perception that the rich and powerful can simply do as they please.
According to news reports, Zhang amassed a fortune through a chain of traditional Chinese medicine clinics he owned, or through private acupuncture sessions.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,S&P sector reshuffle may do little for telecom stocks,"The S&P 500’s three-company telecommunications services index .SPLRCL is about to be folded into a much higher-profile group, but a brighter spotlight may not be enough to boost the stocks as investors continue to favor growth sectors.
The three telecom stocks - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), AT&T Inc (T.N) and CenturyLink Inc (CTL.N) - will be included a newly-minted S&P 500 Communications Services Sector on Monday, along with high-flyers including Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O).
The telecom sector has been the biggest loser among the S&P’s 11 major sectors with an 4.4-percent decline so far in 2018, driven by AT&T’s 13.3-percent drop.
In comparison, many of the other companies joining the group have shown strong gains for the year with Netflix rising 91.5 percent, Twitter (TWTR.N) rising 21.7 percent and Alphabet rising 10.8 percent.
To be sure, passive investors will end up with telecom exposure by default if they invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that mirror the new communications index.
But many active investors may still ignore telecom stocks, which are typically viewed as defensive investments because of slower, though relatively predictable, growth rates and high dividends.
Instead, they may look to faster-growing internet or media companies for exposure to the growth oriented communications sector.
“Telecoms are likely to fade into the background,” according to Patrick Palfrey, equity strategist at Credit Suisse.
“Investors aren’t going to look to communications for dividend yield.
They’re going to look to it for businesses that have a tremendous opportunity to grow.”
With interest rates rising and an economic expansion still intact, investors are putting more money into growth sectors than dividend stocks, which tend to do better in times of economic weakness.
And investors looking to balance their portfolio across different sectors with some defensive bets would be unlikely to seek safety in the communications index.
“If you wanted to own safety or dividend yield you’d go to real estate investment trusts or utilities.
Those sectors are uniformly one theme.
That’s dividend yield,” said Palfrey.
Wall Street expects the S&P 500 communications sector to generate 21 percent earnings growth and 11.1 percent revenue growth for 2018, compared with 16.7 percent earnings growth and 7.4 percent revenue growth for the telecom stocks, according to data collected by Thomson Reuters.
Estimates for the next 12 months imply a trading multiple of 18.4 for the communications sector compared with the telecom sector’s multiple of 10.6, according to Thomson Reuters data.
State Street Global advisors created the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC.P) ETF to mirror the reclassified sector while Vanguard created the Vanguard Communication Services index fund (VOX.P).
While the new ETFs will give some support to telecom stocks, the decisions of active investors, could have a bigger impact on performance after the reshuffle as passive investments represent a much smaller portion of equity investments.
According to a 2017 estimate from BlackRock, less than 18 percent of the global stock market is owned by index-tracking investors.
Growth funds with large-cap investments have been sharply outperforming large-cap value funds with a 16.4-percent increase in value so far in 2018 while value counterparts gained 4.4 percent.
In the last five years, growth funds rose 14.9 percent versus 10 percent for value funds, according to Lipper data.
Some stock pickers may take a fresh look at the telephone companies when they join the bigger index, which will make up 10 percent of the S&P 500 compared with the current telecom sector’s a 2 percent weighting, according to Todd Rosenbluth, Director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA.
And value investors seeking high dividends would still opt for telecom stocks over their faster growing counterparts in the sector because they are cheaper, he said.
But even the strategists who were most hopeful for a boost from the reclassification sounded cautious.
“Telecoms is probably one of those areas where people have been leaning too heavily on the negative side,” said Sameer Samana, global equity and technical strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.
“It’s not so much that we like it.
It may just be a good time to not be as negative on it.”","['The S&P 500’s three-company telecommunications services index .SPLRCL is about to be folded into a much higher-profile group, but a brighter spotlight may not be enough to boost the stocks as investors continue to favor growth sectors.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Uber's strongest growth comes in depressed Argentina commissions,"Uber’s fastest-growing market in the world is now Argentina, company executives say, attributing the expansion to the nation’s sudden economic unraveling, which has boosted unemployment and sliced the purchasing power of Argentines.
Twenty percent of its drivers in Buenos Aires, the only city where it operates in Argentina, were jobless immediately before joining Uber.
The economic downturn, “has certainly helped many people find us as an alternative source of income,” Felipe Fernandez Aramburu, who runs Uber business development in Argentina, told Reuters in a recent interview.
Despite worries about the country’s economy, which shrank 4.2 percent in the second quarter after its central bank hiked rates to ward off a currency crisis, the company says it does not fear that a recession could boost the number of drivers without an equivalent increase in demand.
“Our growth today is less about economic conditions on the rider side,” said Andrew Macdonald, who runs Uber in Latin America.
Instead, Macdonald expects what he described as a paucity of public transportation options to lift demand in Argentina and said growth was highest in the neighborhoods with the least bus and train service.
But Uber’s Argentine unit still faces a snag: For most rides, the company does not charge its drivers the 25 percent commission it is theoretically owed.
Due to legal and regulatory hurdles, Uber rides in Argentina can only be paid with cash or credit cards issued abroad, which almost no locals have.
When rides are paid in cash, drivers currently have no way to pay Uber its 25 percent commission, leaving many with a growing debt to the company.
Commissions from drivers are Uber’s only source of revenue.
Uber’s Argentine conundrum of being unable to profit from its fast growth there mirrors a wider problem for the ride hailing service, which has struggled to prove that it can be profitable as it gears up for a planned 2019 initial public offering.
‘TOO MANY DRIVERS’
Macdonald played down those concerns, however.
“It’s not about whether we are making money in the near term,” he said, adding that the company will “eventually” have to charge those commissions.
Macdonald would not say whether the Argentine market is profitable.
Uber has disclosed that its operations in nearby Brazil - now the company’s second-biggest market worldwide - are profitable.
Once Uber can accept local credit and debit cards, it will be able to recoup what it is owed, the company said.
Drivers, however, say the current Argentine growth rate may be temporary, tied to the lack of a commission charge.
“What’s going on is that there are too many drivers currently and so there’s less work for us,” said Jorge, a 62-year old Uber driver who requested anonymity.
“Everyone’s coming to Uber because they don’t charge a commission.”
Uber says that in the last three months, it has had 55,000 active drivers and 1 million active users in Buenos Aires.
Each day, the company said it adds between 300 and 400 new drivers and 7,000 new users.
There’s also attrition in the mix.
“The average lifespan for a driver in Latin America is about three to four months.
It means they use Uber as something temporary,” Fernandez Aramburu said.
Uber’s recruitment success reflects a wider trend within Argentina, where a rising jobless rate has hit full-time jobs with benefits in particular, economists say.
“We are going through a process that is making labor rights more precarious, and formal employment is dwindling,” said Hernan Letcher, director of the Center for Argentine Economic Policy.
Uber has been operating in Argentina since 2016, when it faced aggressive resistance from taxi drivers and government authorities, including legal disputes that led to the ban on credit card payments that is still in place.
There is no regulatory framework for Uber in Buenos Aires, including no way for the government to collect sales tax on the rides.
Macdonald said the company welcomes favorable regulation and that accepting local credit cards is a priority, which will make more drivers pay their 25 percent commission but could also increase Uber’s business.
“It’s a testament to our investment in Argentina ... that we are able to grow so much even without being able to offer the convenience of all payment options,” Macdonald said.","['Uber’s fastest-growing market in the world is now Argentina, company executives say, attributing the expansion to the nation’s sudden economic unraveling, which has boosted unemployment and sliced the purchasing power of Argentines.'

Macdonald said the company welcomes favorable regulation and that accepting local credit cards is a priority, which will make more drivers pay their 25 percent commission but could also increase Uber’s business. “It’s a testament to our investment in Argentina ... that we are able to grow so much even without being able to offer the convenience of all payment options,” Macdonald said.","“Everyone’s coming to Uber because they don’t charge a commission.” Macdonald would not say whether the Argentine market is profitable. Uber’s Argentine conundrum of being unable to profit from its fast growth there mirrors a wider problem for the ride hailing service, which has struggled to prove that it can be profitable as it gears up for a planned 2019 initial public offering. It means they use Uber as something temporary,” Fernandez Aramburu said. Uber has been operating in Argentina since 2016, when it faced aggressive resistance from taxi drivers and government authorities, including legal disputes that led to the ban on credit card payments that is still in place. But Uber’s Argentine unit still faces a snag: For most rides, the company does not charge its drivers the 25 percent commission it is theoretically owed. Instead, Macdonald expects what he described as a paucity of public transportation options to lift demand in Argentina and said growth was highest in the neighborhoods with the least bus and train service. Macdonald played down those concerns, however. ‘TOO MANY DRIVERS’ Uber has disclosed that its operations in nearby Brazil - now the company’s second-biggest market worldwide - are profitable. Commissions from drivers are Uber’s only source of revenue. “We are going through a process that is making labor rights more precarious, and formal employment is dwindling,” said Hernan Letcher, director of the Center for Argentine Economic Policy. “It’s a testament to our investment in Argentina ... that we are able to grow so much even without being able to offer the convenience of all payment options,” Macdonald said. There’s also attrition in the mix. Once Uber can accept local credit and debit cards, it will be able to recoup what it is owed, the company said. There is no regulatory framework for Uber in Buenos Aires, including no way for the government to collect sales tax on the rides. Twenty percent of its drivers in Buenos Aires, the only city where it operates in Argentina, were jobless immediately before joining Uber. “It’s not about whether we are making money in the near term,” he said, adding that the company will “eventually” have to charge those commissions. “What’s going on is that there are too many drivers currently and so there’s less work for us,” said Jorge, a 62-year old Uber driver who requested anonymity. The economic downturn, “has certainly helped many people find us as an alternative source of income,” Felipe Fernandez Aramburu, who runs Uber business development in Argentina, told Reuters in a recent interview. Drivers, however, say the current Argentine growth rate may be temporary, tied to the lack of a commission charge. Each day, the company said it adds between 300 and 400 new drivers and 7,000 new users. Macdonald said the company welcomes favorable regulation and that accepting local credit cards is a priority, which will make more drivers pay their 25 percent commission but could also increase Uber’s business. “Our growth today is less about economic conditions on the rider side,” said Andrew Macdonald, who runs Uber in Latin America. Uber’s recruitment success reflects a wider trend within Argentina, where a rising jobless rate has hit full-time jobs with benefits in particular, economists say. Due to legal and regulatory hurdles, Uber rides in Argentina can only be paid with cash or credit cards issued abroad, which almost no locals have. When rides are paid in cash, drivers currently have no way to pay Uber its 25 percent commission, leaving many with a growing debt to the company. “The average lifespan for a driver in Latin America is about three to four months. Uber’s fastest-growing market in the world is now Argentina, company executives say, attributing the expansion to the nation’s sudden economic unraveling, which has boosted unemployment and sliced the purchasing power of Argentines. Despite worries about the country’s economy, which shrank 4.2 percent in the second quarter after its central bank hiked rates to ward off a currency crisis, the company says it does not fear that a recession could boost the number of drivers without an equivalent increase in demand. Uber says that in the last three months, it has had 55,000 active drivers and 1 million active users in Buenos Aires.","[2, 0, 1]","[5, 7, 9]"
Generate a news article for the following headline.,Gulf Region Gains Help in New Law on War Funds,"State and local governments in Gulf Coast areas devastated by the 2005 hurricanes will no longer be required to pay 10 percent of the cost of repairing their roads, schools and other public works, under a provision of the emergency war spending bill approved by Congress on Thursday night.
Louisiana officials had said that the need to cover some of the repair costs themselves, instead of having the federal government assume all costs, was significantly slowing their recovery efforts.
They praised Congress for making the change, which they estimated would save the state and its affected communities at least $775 million.
Mississippi will also benefit from the change, to a lesser degree.
The Bush administration had earlier opposed lifting the requirement, but after long and intense negotiations with Congress over the much larger provision financing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the president signed the bill yesterday.
""We are thrilled,"" Gov.
Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana said in a telephone interview.
The exemption, Ms. Blanco said, will particularly help local governments crippled by the storms.
In addition to the direct financial advantage, the waiver will reduce the paperwork that local governments must complete to get federal financing for infrastructure, said Andy Kopplin, executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority.
That in itself will save some money, and will also hasten rebuilding.
""This definitely puts the foot down on the accelerator in terms of speeding up the recovery,"" Mr. Kopplin said.
Under a law enacted by Congress in 1988, the Federal Emergency Management Agency can pay for 90 percent of infrastructure repairs after significant natural disasters.
The requirement that state and local governments match that by paying the other 10 percent was intended to prevent fraud and waste by giving them a financial stake in their own projects.
Louisiana intends to use money freed by the new waiver to help shore up its federally financed program helping homeowners rebuild their houses.
That program, called the Road Home, is facing an eventual shortfall of about $2.9 billion, according to state estimates.
More families have applied than the state anticipated, and have qualified for higher-than-expected grants.
New Orleans has been counting on the waiver to help pay for its own rebuilding plan.
Mayor C. Ray Nagin issued a statement yesterday saying the city was very pleased with the exemption, which he called critical to recovery.
Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, had made a concerted effort to get Congress to waive the 10 percent requirement.
Ms. Landrieu was able to get a waiver included in a previous version of the war spending bill as well, but that measure was vetoed by President Bush because of its troop-withdrawal timetable.
Although the federal government eliminated the payment requirement after past disasters like Sept. 11 and Hurricane Andrew, the administration refused to do so after the 2005 hurricanes, arguing that it had given Louisiana enough federal money to cover the local governments' share of the costs.
But Louisiana officials said that this money came with significant strings attached and that qualifying for it put a huge regulatory burden on overwhelmed local governments, which have applied for federal assistance for about 20,000 projects so far.
States and localities also said they simply did not have the money to put up a 10 percent match.
The waiver is not the only help that the newly enacted law affords the gulf region.
The measure also includes $1.3 billion for repairs to levees along the Mississippi River around New Orleans, and permits the federal government to forgive repayment of disaster loans made to the communities affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
In addition, it provides for grants for various recovery programs in the region, including one to recruit teachers in Louisiana and another to fight crime by helping New Orleans pay for more police officers and prosecutors.","['State and local governments in Gulf Coast areas devastated by the 2005 hurricanes will no longer be required to pay 10 percent of the cost of repairing their roads, schools and other public works, under a provision of the emergency war spending bill approved by Congress on Thursday night.'

That program, called the Road Home, is facing an eventual shortfall of about $2.9 billion, according to state estimates. The waiver is not the only help that the newly enacted law affords the gulf region. Louisiana intends to use money freed by the new waiver to help shore up its federally financed program helping homeowners rebuild their houses. They praised Congress for making the change, which they estimated would save the state and its affected communities at least $775 million. Mayor C. Ray Nagin issued a statement yesterday saying the city was very pleased with the exemption, which he called critical to recovery. The measure also includes $1.3 billion for repairs to levees along the Mississippi River around New Orleans, and permits the federal government to forgive repayment of disaster loans made to the communities affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Bush administration had earlier opposed lifting the requirement, but after long and intense negotiations with Congress over the much larger provision financing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the president signed the bill yesterday. But Louisiana officials said that this money came with significant strings attached and that qualifying for it put a huge regulatory burden on overwhelmed local governments, which have applied for federal assistance for about 20,000 projects so far. The exemption, Ms. Blanco said, will particularly help local governments crippled by the storms. In addition to the direct financial advantage, the waiver will reduce the paperwork that local governments must complete to get federal financing for infrastructure, said Andy Kopplin, executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority. State and local governments in Gulf Coast areas devastated by the 2005 hurricanes will no longer be required to pay 10 percent of the cost of repairing their roads, schools and other public works, under a provision of the emergency war spending bill approved by Congress on Thursday night. Mississippi will also benefit from the change, to a lesser degree. Although the federal government eliminated the payment requirement after past disasters like Sept. 11 and Hurricane Andrew, the administration refused to do so after the 2005 hurricanes, arguing that it had given Louisiana enough federal money to cover the local governments' share of the costs.","State and local governments in Gulf Coast areas devastated by the 2005 hurricanes will no longer be required to pay 10 percent of the cost of repairing their roads, schools and other public works, under a provision of the emergency war spending bill approved by Congress on Thursday night.

In addition to the direct financial advantage, the waiver will reduce the paperwork that local governments must complete to get federal financing for infrastructure, said Andy Kopplin, executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority. That in itself will save some money, and will also hasten rebuilding. ""This definitely puts the foot down on the accelerator in terms of speeding up the recovery,"" Mr. Kopplin said. Under a law enacted by Congress in 1988, the Federal Emergency Management Agency can pay for 90 percent of infrastructure repairs after significant natural disasters. The requirement that state and local governments match that by paying the other 10 percent was intended to prevent fraud and waste by giving them a financial stake in their own projects. Louisiana intends to use money freed by the new waiver to help shore up its federally financed program helping homeowners rebuild their houses. That program, called the Road Home, is facing an eventual shortfall of about $2.9 billion, according to state estimates. More families have applied than the state anticipated, and have qualified for higher-than-expected grants. New Orleans has been counting on the waiver to help pay for its own rebuilding plan. Mayor C. Ray Nagin issued a statement yesterday saying the city was very pleased with the exemption, which he called critical to recovery. Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, had made a concerted effort to get Congress to waive the 10 percent requirement. Ms. Landrieu was able to get a waiver included in a previous version of the war spending bill as well, but that measure was vetoed by President Bush because of its troop-withdrawal timetable. Although the federal government eliminated the payment requirement after past disasters like Sept. 11 and Hurricane Andrew, the administration refused to do so after the 2005 hurricanes, arguing that it had given Louisiana enough federal money to cover the local governments' share of the costs. But Louisiana officials said that this money came with significant strings attached and that qualifying for it put a huge regulatory burden on overwhelmed local governments, which have applied for federal assistance for about 20,000 projects so far.

The measure also includes $1.3 billion for repairs to levees along the Mississippi River around New Orleans, and permits the federal government to forgive repayment of disaster loans made to the communities affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In addition, it provides for grants for various recovery programs in the region, including one to recruit teachers in Louisiana and another to fight crime by helping New Orleans pay for more police officers and prosecutors.","[2, 1, 0]","[9, 7, 8]"
Generate a news article for the following headline.,"Qualcomm will not exit data center business, chip chief says","Qualcomm Inc has no plans to abandon its efforts to create processors for data centers, the company’s president, who oversees the chip division, said.
Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips in mobile phones, last year launched chips that use technology from Softbank Group Corp’s ARM Holdings to power the workhorse computer servers behind cloud-based services such as social networks.
Qualcomm’s push to enter the data center market puts it in direct competition with Intel Corp, which dominates data centers and now draws half of its revenue from servers and other “data centric” chips.
But in May, Bloomberg reported that Qualcomm was exploring whether to sell or shut down the server chip unit.
Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon told Reuters on Monday that the chipmaker is making staff reductions in the unit but intends to keep operating it, albeit with a narrower focus on large internet companies in the United States and China.
“We are not looking at strategic options.
We are not selling.
We are still focused on it,” Amon told Reuters.
San Diego-based Qualcomm declined to say whether it had considered selling the server chip unit at some point in the past.
The company instead pointed to an April earnings call in which Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf said Qualcomm was considering cost-cutting options in areas that are not central to Qualcomm’s business, which overwhelmingly comes from selling chips and licensing technology for mobile phones.
Amon told Reuters that the server chip business will be rolled into Qualcom’s Qualcomm CDMA Technologies unit, which designs and sells mobile phone chips, to gain cost efficiencies.
Amon said the restructured server chip unit will focus on large cloud computing players.
He would not name U.S. targets, but said the company is hoping to sell to Chinese internet giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Tencent Holdings Ltd and Baidu Inc through a joint venture in China.
Large internet companies tend to write much of their own internal software and can customize it for Qualcomm’s chips.
That means they will not struggle like smaller players to adapt off-the-shelf data center software that is overwhelmingly written to run on Intel’s so-called x86 chips.
“It’s very clear to us that the ARM opportunity is focused on a few players where you don’t have the software x86 barrier to entry,” Amon said.","['Qualcomm Inc has no plans to abandon its efforts to create processors for data centers, the company’s president, who oversees the chip division, said.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"Exclusive: Campbell Soup steps up CEO search, COO a contender","Campbell Soup Co’s (CPB.N) board is drawing up a list of CEO candidates, with Chief Operating Officer Luca Mignini emerging as the top internal contender, as the company seeks to fend off a proxy challenge from Daniel Loeb’s hedge fund, Third Point LLC, people familiar with the matter said.
Third Point unveiled a slate of nominees on Friday to replace Campbell’s 12-member board, pushing it to more actively explore a sale and criticizing its lack of a succession plan after Chief Executive Denise Morrison left in May.
Morrison’s departure came after several years of weak corporate earnings.
Campbell board member Keith McLoughlin, who has served as interim CEO since Morrison’s departure, has said he is not interested in the job on a permanent basis.
That has added to pressure on Campbell to find a leader who will help it execute an ambitious turnaround plan it unveiled last month.
Despite Morrison’s exit almost four months ago, the board has only recently taken formal steps to look externally for a new CEO, according to the sources.
Mignini, 55, joined Campbell five years ago and was promoted in April to be its COO, putting the Italian-educated executive in charge of the U.S. company’s snack and meal businesses, in addition to U.S. sales and global development.
Morrison also held the COO position before she took the top job in 2011.
Investors who met with McLoughlin and Campbell Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro in recent days told Reuters that Mignini joined the meetings, in a sign the company was seeking to raise his profile.
Mignini did not usually attend such meetings in the past, the investors said.
CNBC reported in May, at the time of Morrison’s departure, that Mignini was a likely candidate for the CEO seat.
The board is also preparing to interview candidates from outside the company, although nobody external has been contacted yet, according to one of the people familiar with the arrangements.
Campbell’s board, which includes three heirs of John Dorrance, the chemist who invented condensed soup and ran the company nearly a century ago, will review a list of external candidates at its next meeting at the end of September, the source added.
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.
A Campbell spokesman declined to comment on whether Mignini was the top internal candidate and said the board had been working with executive-search firms to assess both internal and external candidates.
Third Point declined to comment.
Campbell Soup shares were up 0.5 percent at $40.40 in early morning trading on Monday, giving the company a market capitalization of about $12 billion.
Third Point’s board challenge could complicate the CEO selection process, given that shareholders could choose to replace board members who will be making that decision, in a vote that could be scheduled as early as November.
The turmoil could discourage some of the consumer industry’s top executives from applying, the sources said.
Third Point faces an uphill struggle in any battle for control of Campbell Soup, given that descendants of Dorrance own a combined stake of about 42 percent in the company.
A board challenge could ratchet up pressure on Campbell, however, to explore a sale with more urgency.
EXTERNAL CANDIDATES
Third Point, which manages $18 billion in assets, has played a role in bringing new CEOs to several companies, including Jose Almeida to Baxter International Inc (BAX.N), Tad Smith to Sotheby’s (BID.N), and Marissa Mayer to Yahoo.
One external CEO candidate Campbell Soup’s board is expected to consider is Mark Clouse, chief executive of Pinnacle Foods Inc PF.N, who will soon be without a full-time job after his company agreed in June to sell itself to ConAgra Brands Inc (CAG.N) for $8.1 billion.
Clouse, 49, is an industry veteran, having also held senior positions at Oreo-maker Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) and Kraft Foods Inc.
It is not clear if Clouse would be interested.
He could not be reached for comment.
Campbell said on Aug. 30 it planned to sell its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units, and only left open the possibility of putting the whole company up for sale in the future, snubbing a call from Third Point to do so urgently.
The 149-year-old company, which revolutionized the home-cooking industry with easy-to-prepare soups and low-cost production techniques, has been struggling to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies.
Campbell’s latest foray into fresh food has faltered, while Wall Street has questioned an acquisition strategy that increased debt at the same time as costs increased.","['Campbell Soup Co’s (CPB.N) board is drawing up a list of CEO candidates, with Chief Operating Officer Luca Mignini emerging as the top internal contender, as the company seeks to fend off a proxy challenge from Daniel Loeb’s hedge fund, Third Point LLC, people familiar with the matter said.'

Third Point unveiled a slate of nominees on Friday to replace Campbell’s 12-member board, pushing it to more actively explore a sale and criticizing its lack of a succession plan after Chief Executive Denise Morrison left in May. Morrison’s departure came after several years of weak corporate earnings. Campbell board member Keith McLoughlin, who has served as interim CEO since Morrison’s departure, has said he is not interested in the job on a permanent basis. That has added to pressure on Campbell to find a leader who will help it execute an ambitious turnaround plan it unveiled last month. Despite Morrison’s exit almost four months ago, the board has only recently taken formal steps to look externally for a new CEO, according to the sources. Mignini, 55, joined Campbell five years ago and was promoted in April to be its COO, putting the Italian-educated executive in charge of the U.S. company’s snack and meal businesses, in addition to U.S. sales and global development. Morrison also held the COO position before she took the top job in 2011. Investors who met with McLoughlin and Campbell Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro in recent days told Reuters that Mignini joined the meetings, in a sign the company was seeking to raise his profile. Mignini did not usually attend such meetings in the past, the investors said. CNBC reported in May, at the time of Morrison’s departure, that Mignini was a likely candidate for the CEO seat. The board is also preparing to interview candidates from outside the company, although nobody external has been contacted yet, according to one of the people familiar with the arrangements. Campbell’s board, which includes three heirs of John Dorrance, the chemist who invented condensed soup and ran the company nearly a century ago, will review a list of external candidates at its next meeting at the end of September, the source added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. A Campbell spokesman declined to comment on whether Mignini was the top internal candidate and said the board had been working with executive-search firms to assess both internal and external candidates. Third Point declined to comment. Campbell Soup shares were up 0.5 percent at $40.40 in early morning trading on Monday, giving the company a market capitalization of about $12 billion.

Despite Morrison’s exit almost four months ago, the board has only recently taken formal steps to look externally for a new CEO, according to the sources. Campbell’s board, which includes three heirs of John Dorrance, the chemist who invented condensed soup and ran the company nearly a century ago, will review a list of external candidates at its next meeting at the end of September, the source added. The board is also preparing to interview candidates from outside the company, although nobody external has been contacted yet, according to one of the people familiar with the arrangements. Third Point declined to comment. Mignini did not usually attend such meetings in the past, the investors said. It is not clear if Clouse would be interested. Campbell’s latest foray into fresh food has faltered, while Wall Street has questioned an acquisition strategy that increased debt at the same time as costs increased. EXTERNAL CANDIDATES Campbell Soup shares were up 0.5 percent at $40.40 in early morning trading on Monday, giving the company a market capitalization of about $12 billion. Campbell said on Aug. 30 it planned to sell its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units, and only left open the possibility of putting the whole company up for sale in the future, snubbing a call from Third Point to do so urgently. Third Point unveiled a slate of nominees on Friday to replace Campbell’s 12-member board, pushing it to more actively explore a sale and criticizing its lack of a succession plan after Chief Executive Denise Morrison left in May. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. The turmoil could discourage some of the consumer industry’s top executives from applying, the sources said. Morrison’s departure came after several years of weak corporate earnings. Third Point’s board challenge could complicate the CEO selection process, given that shareholders could choose to replace board members who will be making that decision, in a vote that could be scheduled as early as November. The 149-year-old company, which revolutionized the home-cooking industry with easy-to-prepare soups and low-cost production techniques, has been struggling to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies. That has added to pressure on Campbell to find a leader who will help it execute an ambitious turnaround plan it unveiled last month. Clouse, 49, is an industry veteran, having also held senior positions at Oreo-maker Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) and Kraft Foods Inc. Morrison also held the COO position before she took the top job in 2011. Investors who met with McLoughlin and Campbell Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro in recent days told Reuters that Mignini joined the meetings, in a sign the company was seeking to raise his profile. One external CEO candidate Campbell Soup’s board is expected to consider is Mark Clouse, chief executive of Pinnacle Foods Inc PF.N, who will soon be without a full-time job after his company agreed in June to sell itself to ConAgra Brands Inc (CAG.N) for $8.1 billion. Campbell Soup Co’s (CPB.N) board is drawing up a list of CEO candidates, with Chief Operating Officer Luca Mignini emerging as the top internal contender, as the company seeks to fend off a proxy challenge from Daniel Loeb’s hedge fund, Third Point LLC, people familiar with the matter said. Campbell board member Keith McLoughlin, who has served as interim CEO since Morrison’s departure, has said he is not interested in the job on a permanent basis. A board challenge could ratchet up pressure on Campbell, however, to explore a sale with more urgency.","[0, 2, 1]","[8, 6, 7]"
Generate a news article for the following headline.,"May triumphs at party conference, but crucial Brexit showdown looms on horizon","British Prime Minister Theresa May stole the show as she brought the four-day Conservative Party Conference to a close Wednesday in Birmingham.
A year ago everything that could go wrong did go wrong, with May struggling to make her speech because of a throat infection, and suffering of the platform backdrop falling apart.
Dancing onto the stage to the tune of Swedish pop group ABBA's hit ""Dancing Queen"", May mocked herself, jokingly saying if she lost her voice it was because she had been up half of the night super gluing the stage set.
Though Labour MP Angela Rayner described the dance with the hashtag cringe, Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry said May's dance was ""an affront to my favorite song"".
Media commentators, usually ultra-critical of leaders' speeches, hailed her plucky performance and her speech.
""The best speech I've ever seen May deliver,"" said one political writer, while another said: ""Best speech of May's premiership.
Ends conference on a high, cements her position as leader.
But nothing has changed.
The Brexit reckoning is delayed.""
The Guardian's summary was that political commentators had generally been very positive, with some thinking it's her best yet.
Although, added the Guardian, there is quite a lot of skepticism about whether she can deliver.
In her speech, May promised to deliver the Brexit the British people had voted for and there would be no referendum or people's vote -- laid into the prospect of a Labour government led by its leader Jeremy Corbyn.
She announced local councils would be free to borrow as much as they wanted too for a massive social house building program.
She also threw in that a decade of austerity was finally over for Britain.
The auditorium packed with Conservative Party loyalists gave her a standing ovation before heading home with a message in their ears that Britain must remain united as it plans its life away from the European Union (EU).
Political opponents, however, were not as enthused as Conservative supporters of May.
Labour's Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, said: ""Theresa May's claim that austerity is over is a con.
If the Prime Minister wants to back up her words with action, Philip Hammond should announce immediately that the cuts scheduled for the next four years will be cancelled.""
""If he cannot, or will not, then Theresa May's announcement today was not just empty -- it was clearly a deceitful attempt to trick the public.""
Ian Lavery, chair of the main opposition Labour Party, said: While the country is crying out for real change, all Theresa May and her party offer are pinched ideas and tinkering around at the edges, relying on petty attacks to cover up their lack of vision.""
""Austerity is not an economic necessity.
It is a political choice made by the Conservatives to hack away at our public services and communities, leaving workers worse off while gifting huge tax cuts to big business.
And as long as Britain has a Conservative prime minister, we'll never see an end to austerity.""
Vince Cable, leader of the minority Liberal Democrats said: ""As somebody who takes dancing seriously, I was delighted to see Theresa May show that she is developing her new hobby.
But she was dancing on the head of a pin, confronted by an audience full of people plotting to oust her.""
Cable said that May said the Conservatives must be a party for the whole country, adding ""yet she has overseen widening divisions in our society.
Trapped by the rabid ideologues of the Conservative right-wing, Mrs May has been driven to illiberal extremes on Brexit, welfare and immigration.""
The Local Government Association which represents hundreds of town halls and city halls, described her decision to lift the borrowing cap for building houses as fantastic.
Its chairman Lord Porter said: ""Our national housing shortage is one of the most pressing issues we face and it is clear that only an increase of all types of housing, including those for affordable or social rent, will solve the housing crisis.""
Away from politics, the Confederation of British Industry director general Carolyn Fairbairn, said: ""The Prime Minister's unambiguous call to back business is welcome.
Unity in politics can be matched by unity between government and business.
Championing a pro-enterprise economy is the only way to show the world that Britain is a fantastic place to create the products and services that power growth.""
""A new relationship with Europe based on the Chequers model with frictionless trade has strong business support.
The Prime Minister has stood her ground, resisting the fiction that a Canada-style deal works for jobs.
Now politicians should support her to get a deal -- and the critical withdrawal agreement -- over the line.""
""Brexit must not suck the oxygen out of domestic policy.
Here too there will be support from firms large and small.
A renewed approach to housing and education will lift productivity and improve people's lives,"" added Fairbairn.
James Forsyth, political editor of the Spectator magazine and a columnist at the Sun newspaper said: ""May delivers one of her best speeches, and will send activists home in better heart than they expected this morning.""
But he added that with May facing a crucial meeting of the European Council in two weeks, Brexit will soon reassert itself.","['British Prime Minister Theresa May stole the show as she brought the four-day Conservative Party Conference to a close Wednesday in Birmingham.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,SALVADORAN LINKED TO KILLING TO SERVE TIME IN U.S. PRISON,"MEXICO CITY - A former colonel in the Salvadoran military accused of planning the killing of six Jesuit priests during that country’s civil war has been sentenced to 21 months in a U.S. prison for immigration violations.
The sentence, handed down in Boston on Tuesday, could set the stage for his extradition to Spain, where he would be one of the few top-ranking officers to face trial in the 1989 killings.
Five of the six priests were Spanish, and Spain is seeking his extradition because it is unlikely that El Salvador - where an amnesty law has allowed other suspects in the crime to remain free - will prosecute him.
If convicted in Spain, he could face up to 30 years in prison.
The former colonel, Inocente Orlando Montano, 71, was El Salvador’s vice minister of public safety at the time of the killings, which brought international condemnation.
When he was arrested in 2011, he had been living in a Boston suburb for 10 years.
He pleaded guilty in September to charges of immigration fraud and perjury related to his application for temporary humanitarian status to remain legally in the United States.
Almudena Bernabéu, a lawyer with the Center for Justice and Accountability in San Francisco, which has pursued the case, said that the United States had indicated it would be amenable to extraditing Montano once he served his sentence for immigration fraud.
Extradition proceedings could take more than a year.
“With the conclusion of this sentencing, the hope is that the United States will, in fact, revise and respond positively to the extradition request,” Bernabéu said.
Montano had been granted a special immigration status that shielded him from deportation, which he had received after lying about his military service and the date he entered the United States, prosecutors said.
An assistant U.S. attorney, John A. Capin, argued that Montano came to the United States to avoid criminal prosecution for his role in the killings.
Montano’s lawyer said that an amnesty was in effect when he left El Salvador, making the former colonel, who he said faced economic hardship at the time, immune to prosecution in his home country.
A 1993 U.N.
Truth Commission report named Montano a participant in the plot to kill the priests, whom military officers suspected of collaborating with left-wing guerrillas.
They, their housekeeper and her teenage daughter were killed in a raid on the Jesuit-run University of Central America in San Salvador.
In 2011, a Spanish National Court judge issued arrest warrants for 20 men, including Montano, suspected of participating in the slaying of the priests.
The judge also requested the extradition of 15 of the 20 - the main suspects - but the Salvadoran Supreme Court denied that request.
“The sentence of 21 months sends a message to human rights abusers that they cannot seek safe haven in the United States and avoid accountability for their actions,” said a statement from the Center for Justice and Accountability.","['MEXICO CITY - A former colonel in the Salvadoran military accused of planning the killing of six Jesuit priests during that country’s civil war has been sentenced to 21 months in a U.S. prison for immigration violations.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Minnesota officer charged with murder in Australian's death,"The Minneapolis police officer who fatally shot an unarmed Australian woman last July was arrested on Tuesday on charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, prosecutors said.
Mohamed Noor, 32, turned himself in and was arrested for the death of Justine Damond, 40, who had called 911 about a possible sexual assault near her house, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said at a news conference announcing the charges.
“There is no evidence that Officer Noor encountered a threat, appreciated a threat, investigated a threat or confirmed a threat that justified his decision to use deadly force,” Freeman said.
“Instead, Officer Noor recklessly and intentionally fired his handgun.”
After Noor shot her, Damond put her hands on the gunshot wound on the left side of her abdomen and said, “I’m dying” or “I’m dead,” Freeman said.
The shooting drew condemnation in Minnesota and Australia, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called it “shocking” and “inexplicable.” Then-Minneapolis police chief Jamee Harteau resigned after city officials said procedures had been violated and Damond “didn’t have to die.”
The third-degree murder charge accused Noor of committing an “eminently dangerous act” and showing a “depraved mind,” and the second-degree manslaughter charge cited “culpable negligence creating unreasonable risk,” the records showed.
The penalty for third-degree murder is up to 25 years in prison and second-degree manslaughter carries a penalty of up to 10 years, according to a state website.
Freeman, Minneapolis’ top prosecutor, had delayed his decision in December, saying his office needed more time and that he lacked sufficient evidence to charge Noor.
Noor has been on paid leave and refused to be interviewed by Minnesota state investigators.
Noor’s attorney, Tom Plunkett, said his client should not be charged.
“The loss of Justine Ruszczyk Damond is a tragedy and Officer Noor again personally extends his continued condolences to her family for their loss,” Plunkett said in a statement.
“The facts will show that Officer Noor acted as he has been trained and consistent with established departmental policy,” Plunkett added.
“Officer Noor should not have been charged with any crime.”
‘INIQUITOUS ACT’
Damond’s fiance, Don Damond, and her father, John Ruszczyk, issued a joint statement in which they praised the decision to charge Noor and hoped it resulted in a conviction, calling it “one step toward justice for this iniquitous act.”
“No charges can bring our Justine back.
However, justice demands accountability for those responsible for recklessly killing the fellow citizens they are sworn to protect,” they said in the statement.
Damond, who was living in Minneapolis and engaged to be married, approached the police after their arrival, authorities have said.
She had owned a meditation and life-coaching company.
Neither Noor, who came to the United States from Somalia as a child, nor Matthew Harrity, another officer in the patrol car, had their body cameras activated, police have said.
Harrity was startled by a loud sound near the patrol car shortly before Noor fired from the passenger seat of the patrol car through Harrity’s window, Freeman said.
Harrity, who pulled out his handgun during the incident but did not fire it, said both officers “got spooked” when Damond appeared “out of nowhere,” Freeman said.
Noor is scheduled to make an initial court appearance on Wednesday in Hennepin County District Court in Minneapolis.
Prosecutors are asking that Noor’s bail be set at $500,000, Freeman said.","['The Minneapolis police officer who fatally shot an unarmed Australian woman last July was arrested on Tuesday on charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, prosecutors said.'

Mohamed Noor, 32, turned himself in and was arrested for the death of Justine Damond, 40, who had called 911 about a possible sexual assault near her house, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said at a news conference announcing the charges. “There is no evidence that Officer Noor encountered a threat, appreciated a threat, investigated a threat or confirmed a threat that justified his decision to use deadly force,” Freeman said. “Instead, Officer Noor recklessly and intentionally fired his handgun.” After Noor shot her, Damond put her hands on the gunshot wound on the left side of her abdomen and said, “I’m dying” or “I’m dead,” Freeman said. The shooting drew condemnation in Minnesota and Australia, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called it “shocking” and “inexplicable.” Then-Minneapolis police chief Jamee Harteau resigned after city officials said procedures had been violated and Damond “didn’t have to die.” The third-degree murder charge accused Noor of committing an “eminently dangerous act” and showing a “depraved mind,” and the second-degree manslaughter charge cited “culpable negligence creating unreasonable risk,” the records showed. The penalty for third-degree murder is up to 25 years in prison and second-degree manslaughter carries a penalty of up to 10 years, according to a state website. Freeman, Minneapolis’ top prosecutor, had delayed his decision in December, saying his office needed more time and that he lacked sufficient evidence to charge Noor. Noor has been on paid leave and refused to be interviewed by Minnesota state investigators. Noor’s attorney, Tom Plunkett, said his client should not be charged. “The loss of Justine Ruszczyk Damond is a tragedy and Officer Noor again personally extends his continued condolences to her family for their loss,” Plunkett said in a statement. “The facts will show that Officer Noor acted as he has been trained and consistent with established departmental policy,” Plunkett added. “Officer Noor should not have been charged with any crime.” ‘INIQUITOUS ACT’ Damond’s fiance, Don Damond, and her father, John Ruszczyk, issued a joint statement in which they praised the decision to charge Noor and hoped it resulted in a conviction, calling it “one step toward justice for this iniquitous act.” “No charges can bring our Justine back. However, justice demands accountability for those responsible for recklessly killing the fellow citizens they are sworn to protect,” they said in the statement. Damond, who was living in Minneapolis and engaged to be married, approached the police after their arrival, authorities have said. She had owned a meditation and life-coaching company. Neither Noor, who came to the United States from Somalia as a child, nor Matthew Harrity, another officer in the patrol car, had their body cameras activated, police have said. Harrity was startled by a loud sound near the patrol car shortly before Noor fired from the passenger seat of the patrol car through Harrity’s window, Freeman said. Harrity, who pulled out his handgun during the incident but did not fire it, said both officers “got spooked” when Damond appeared “out of nowhere,” Freeman said. Noor is scheduled to make an initial court appearance on Wednesday in Hennepin County District Court in Minneapolis. Prosecutors are asking that Noor’s bail be set at $500,000, Freeman said.","['“No charges can bring our Justine back.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"Apple, Salesforce team up to bring Siri to more business apps","Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) are entering a partnership in which the iPhone maker will help Salesforce build the iPhone maker’s features such as its Siri voice assistant deeper into Salesforce’s own mobile apps, which are widely used in the sales and marketing industries.
In exchange, Salesforce will make software tools so that the big businesses that use its back-end technology to power their own apps can build better products with features specific to iPhones and iPads.
Apple and Salesforce both have huge ecosystems of third-party software developers.
About 20 million developers make software for Apple devices, most of them focused on the consumer, while Salesforce has about 5 million developers who tap into its back-end systems to build business applications - a market that Apple has been expanding into through deals with International Business Machines (IBM.N), Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) and Accenture (ACN.N).
The partnership means that a salesperson can use Siri after a customer meeting to update that customer’s record with notes from the meeting, flag a customer service issue for a support team to follow-up on and many other data-entry tasks that can eat up valuable time.
“If you look at enterprise in general, voice has not been used as much as in consumer,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview.
“We’re going to be able to provide the sales rep instant access to things using your voice instead of clicks and going through different apps.
We’re changing the way people work, and that’s always been at the heart of what Apple is about - changing things for the better.”
In exchange, Salesforce is building tools so companies that tap into its back-end systems can make better use of Apple-specific features like Siri.
At Salesforce’s annual customer conference this week, Marriott International will demonstrate a new system that uses Salesforce and Apple tools so that hotel guests can turn up the heat, order a sandwich or hail a ride using Siri with an Apple HomePod in their hotel room.
And at the next Marriot the guest stays at, Siri will remember the guest’s preferences - even their favorite sandwich, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told Reuters in an interview.
“I don’t think I’ve met with a single customer in the world that doesn’t want me to help them do more with Tim’s products,” Benioff said Cook and Apple in the interview.
Salesforce also runs an educational platform called Trailhead, where it says one in four people who take courses in how to build business apps with Salesforce’s tools ends up getting a raise or promotion.
As part of the deal, Apple and Salesforce will add courses on how to develop iPhone and iPad applications.
“These people are learning the tech skills that are elevating their careers,” Benioff said.","['Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) are entering a partnership in which the iPhone maker will help Salesforce build the iPhone maker’s features such as its Siri voice assistant deeper into Salesforce’s own mobile apps, which are widely used in the sales and marketing industries.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Drugmaker Aspen sells baby milk business to dairy giant Lactalis,"Aspen Pharmacare has agreed to sell its infant formula business to Lactalis for 12.9 billion rand ($865 million) to focus on core activities while the French buyer looks to revive its baby milk expansion after a health scandal.
Investors in the South African drugmaker appeared unimpressed, however, after expectations that the deal could top $1 billion.
The company’s share price tumbled after the deal’s announcement on Thursday alongside full-year earnings, dropping 26 percent before paring losses to stand 16.3 percent down at 228.06 rand by 1430 GMT.
Rising incomes in emerging markets coupled with global population growth have made infant formula an attractive proposition in a market dominated by Nestle, Danone and Reckitt Benckiser, which acquired Mead Johnson of the United States last year.
“The market expected Aspen to get $1 billion to $1.5 billion dollars,” Cratos Capital equity trader Greg Davies said, adding that there is also some doubt over Aspen’s stated growth expectations.
FNB Wealth and Investments portfolio manager Wayne McCurrie said a “second disappointment” concerned Aspen’s rising debt levels and whether Africa’s biggest manufacturer of generic drugs had been forced to sell the infant milk business to reduce gearing levels.
“The market is worried that they took a decision just on debt and not on the growth prospects of the business, because this business looked quite good,” McCurrie said.
“They were pumping it massively over the last year or so and all of a sudden say they are selling it.”
Aspen CEO Stephen Saad said the disposal was in line with “our strategic intention to focus attention on our core pharmaceutical business, which includes the anesthetics, thrombosis and high potency and cytotoxic portfolios”.
After 1.1 billion rand to be paid to partners in Asia-Pacific, Aspen will receive 11.8 billion rand, representing 23 times the unit’s earnings of 512 million rand, Deputy Chief Executive Gus Attridge said.
CHANCE TO REBUILD
For Lactalis, meanwhile, the deal represents an opportunity to rebuild its baby milk business after a salmonella outbreak at its production site in northwest France caused dozens of babies to fall sick and led to a global product recall.
Lactalis is the world’s largest dairy firm, with annual sales of 18.4 billion euros ($21.4 billion), but baby milk has been a relatively small part of its activities and is now at a standstill after the health scare.
The company’s head of communications, Michel Nalet, said the production halt in France was “one of the factors” behind the move for the Aspen business
“In infant formula, we didn’t have a base outside France.
We had the desire to be a global player in all dairy businesses,” he said.
Aspen’s nutritionals business sells infant milk formula in the Asia-Pacific region, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, and has been building a growing presence in the Middle East and China.
Privately owned Lactalis, which said the crisis could cost it hundreds of million of euros, decided the production line linked to the contamination should be closed permanently and is now awaiting permission from French authorities to restart output at its other production line.
The acquisition will be funded with cash, Aspen said, adding that the proceeds will reduce its debt and that the deal is expected to close in the next six months.
Lactalis will also receive any intellectual property and goodwill presently owned by Aspen Holdings and Pharmacare Ltd and Aspen Global Incorporated.
Aspen’s infant formula business contributed 3.1 billion rand to group revenue in the year to June 30.
The drugmaker posted full-year normalized earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 12 billion rand, up 5 percent, helped by strong growth in China, inclusion of anesthetics portfolios acquired the previous year and positive organic growth in commercial pharmaceuticals.
Aspen declared a dividend of 315 cents per share, up 10 percent.","['Aspen Pharmacare has agreed to sell its infant formula business to Lactalis for 12.9 billion rand ($865 million) to focus on core activities while the French buyer looks to revive its baby milk expansion after a health scandal.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"The new Democratic majority in Congress is divided over how to assert its power in opposing President Bush's plan to send more troops to Baghdad, as leaders explore ways to block financing for a military expansion without being accused of abandoning American forces already in Iraq.
While Democrats find themselves unusually united in their resistance to a troop increase, party leaders are locked in an internal debate over how far to go in objecting to the administration's Iraq strategy.
The White House has invited some Democrats to meet with Mr. Bush before he gives his Iraq speech on Wednesday, even as others have scoured the history books to find cases when Congress has reined in the commander in chief.
In the most aggressive of the new tactics, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, has said he will introduce legislation on Tuesday to require the president to gain new Congressional authority before sending more troops to Iraq.
The bill is the first proposal in the Senate that would prohibit paying for an increase in American troops over their level on Jan. 1.
""Is there any American in this country who thinks the United States Senate would vote to support sending American troops into a civil war in Iraq today?""
Mr. Kennedy said Monday in an interview.
""Is there any American that believes this?
I don't think so, but that is what's happening, and we have to do everything we can to insist on accountability.""
The Kennedy plan is intended to provide Democrats with a road map for how to proceed in Iraq.
Mr. Kennedy, as he begins his 45th year in the Senate, recalled that Congress interceded during conflicts in Vietnam and Lebanon, and he said Democrats should not hesitate to do so in Iraq.
The new House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, has similarly suggested that Democrats consider blocking financing for a troop increase, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, vowed Monday ""to take a look at it.""
But the House majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, has not endorsed the idea.
Other Democrats, either looking ahead to a possible presidential candidacy or their own re-elections, have also distanced themselves from such a proposal, fearful of being cast as opposing the troops.
""I don't think we should be pulling back any funds,"" said Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who was elected in November.
She said she would oppose a proposal to block money for a troop increase.
The Democratic Party sailed to victory in midterm elections in the fall on a promise to change course in Iraq.
Still, there is little consensus over how to proceed.
Some Democrats are urging an immediate withdrawal of troops and a drastic reduction in war spending.
Others are calling for a gradual re-deployment of troops to move them out of Iraq.
Still other Democrats are waiting for Mr. Bush to present his plan before criticizing it.
The expectations set by the elections, Democrats say, present a complicating challenge as they begin to govern.
Take, for example, Mr. Reid, who said on Dec. 17 that he would support a plan for a temporary increase in increase troops.
Two weeks later, he announced his opposition, saying his change had nothing to do with other Democratic senators having spoken out against it, but rather with military officials having disagreed with a call for more troops.
Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said he believed that his party lost the White House in 2004 because of Iraq.
""My concern now is that too many Democrats are going to want to play it safe on this issue and not take the strong stand that American people demand,"" he said Monday.
The pressure from war critics on the Democratic left has been particularly intense.
""The bottom line is that they were elected on a mandate to get the nation out of the mess in Iraq,"" said Eli Pariser, the executive director of MoveOn.org, a liberal political action committee.
By law, Congress can limit the nature of troop deployments, cap the size of military deployments and cut financing for existing or prospective deployments.
Since 1970, there have been dozens of occasions in which Congress has tried to step into military action, from Haiti to Bosnia to Kosovo, according to a memorandum being sent Tuesday to lawmakers by the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy group.
Representative Adam Smith of Washington, vice chairman of the moderate New Democratic Coalition, said he feared that withholding financing -- even for new troops being sent to Iraq -- could have a detrimental effect on all forces.
""I don't want our troops to be caught between the president and Congress in a political fight,"" said Mr. Smith, who was to receive a briefing on Tuesday at the White House.
""If there are any risks that our efforts to slash the budget would place them at greater risk, that would be unacceptable to me.""
But Democrats who are trying to stop Mr. Bush's proposed troop increase, a group led by Mr. Kennedy, say their proposal to block financing will apply only to new troops.
Mr. Kennedy said he hoped that his legislation would be urgently considered by the full Senate, but acknowledged that it remained an open question whether his Democratic leaders would schedule it for a quick vote.
""The importance of this legislation is that it will apply now before we could get the escalation,"" he said.
""If you wait, this thing is going to be past.
I'm not sure that all of our colleagues in the Senate understand that, quite frankly.""","[""The new Democratic majority in Congress is divided over how to assert its power in opposing President Bush's plan to send more troops to Baghdad, as leaders explore ways to block financing for a military expansion without being accused of abandoning American forces already in Iraq.""

""Is there any American in this country who thinks the United States Senate would vote to support sending American troops into a civil war in Iraq today?"" Mr. Kennedy said Monday in an interview. ""Is there any American that believes this? I don't think so, but that is what's happening, and we have to do everything we can to insist on accountability."" The Kennedy plan is intended to provide Democrats with a road map for how to proceed in Iraq. Mr. Kennedy, as he begins his 45th year in the Senate, recalled that Congress interceded during conflicts in Vietnam and Lebanon, and he said Democrats should not hesitate to do so in Iraq. The new House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, has similarly suggested that Democrats consider blocking financing for a troop increase, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, vowed Monday ""to take a look at it."" But the House majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, has not endorsed the idea. Other Democrats, either looking ahead to a possible presidential candidacy or their own re-elections, have also distanced themselves from such a proposal, fearful of being cast as opposing the troops. ""I don't think we should be pulling back any funds,"" said Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who was elected in November. She said she would oppose a proposal to block money for a troop increase. The Democratic Party sailed to victory in midterm elections in the fall on a promise to change course in Iraq. Still, there is little consensus over how to proceed. Some Democrats are urging an immediate withdrawal of troops and a drastic reduction in war spending. Others are calling for a gradual re-deployment of troops to move them out of Iraq. Still other Democrats are waiting for Mr. Bush to present his plan before criticizing it. The expectations set by the elections, Democrats say, present a complicating challenge as they begin to govern. Take, for example, Mr. Reid, who said on Dec. 17 that he would support a plan for a temporary increase in increase troops. Two weeks later, he announced his opposition, saying his change had nothing to do with other Democratic senators having spoken out against it, but rather with military officials having disagreed with a call for more troops. Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said he believed that his party lost the White House in 2004 because of Iraq. ""My concern now is that too many Democrats are going to want to play it safe on this issue and not take the strong stand that American people demand,"" he said Monday. The pressure from war critics on the Democratic left has been particularly intense. ""The bottom line is that they were elected on a mandate to get the nation out of the mess in Iraq,"" said Eli Pariser, the executive director of MoveOn.org, a liberal political action committee. By law, Congress can limit the nature of troop deployments, cap the size of military deployments and cut financing for existing or prospective deployments. Since 1970, there have been dozens of occasions in which Congress has tried to step into military action, from Haiti to Bosnia to Kosovo, according to a memorandum being sent Tuesday to lawmakers by the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy group. Representative Adam Smith of Washington, vice chairman of the moderate New Democratic Coalition, said he feared that withholding financing -- even for new troops being sent to Iraq -- could have a detrimental effect on all forces. ""I don't want our troops to be caught between the president and Congress in a political fight,"" said Mr. Smith, who was to receive a briefing on Tuesday at the White House. ""If there are any risks that our efforts to slash the budget would place them at greater risk, that would be unacceptable to me."" But Democrats who are trying to stop Mr. Bush's proposed troop increase, a group led by Mr. Kennedy, say their proposal to block financing will apply only to new troops. Mr. Kennedy said he hoped that his legislation would be urgently considered by the full Senate, but acknowledged that it remained an open question whether his Democratic leaders would schedule it for a quick vote. ""The importance of this legislation is that it will apply now before we could get the escalation,"" he said. ""If you wait, this thing is going to be past. I'm not sure that all of our colleagues in the Senate understand that, quite frankly.""","['The new House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, has similarly suggested that Democrats consider blocking financing for a troop increase, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, vowed Monday ""to take a look at it.""'

""If there are any risks that our efforts to slash the budget would place them at greater risk, that would be unacceptable to me."" But Democrats who are trying to stop Mr. Bush's proposed troop increase, a group led by Mr. Kennedy, say their proposal to block financing will apply only to new troops. Mr. Kennedy said he hoped that his legislation would be urgently considered by the full Senate, but acknowledged that it remained an open question whether his Democratic leaders would schedule it for a quick vote. ""The importance of this legislation is that it will apply now before we could get the escalation,"" he said. ""If you wait, this thing is going to be past. I'm not sure that all of our colleagues in the Senate understand that, quite frankly.""","In the most aggressive of the new tactics, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, has said he will introduce legislation on Tuesday to require the president to gain new Congressional authority before sending more troops to Iraq. The bill is the first proposal in the Senate that would prohibit paying for an increase in American troops over their level on Jan. 1. Mr. Kennedy said Monday in an interview. ""Is there any American that believes this? The White House has invited some Democrats to meet with Mr. Bush before he gives his Iraq speech on Wednesday, even as others have scoured the history books to find cases when Congress has reined in the commander in chief. ""Is there any American in this country who thinks the United States Senate would vote to support sending American troops into a civil war in Iraq today?"" The new Democratic majority in Congress is divided over how to assert its power in opposing President Bush's plan to send more troops to Baghdad, as leaders explore ways to block financing for a military expansion without being accused of abandoning American forces already in Iraq. While Democrats find themselves unusually united in their resistance to a troop increase, party leaders are locked in an internal debate over how far to go in objecting to the administration's Iraq strategy. The new House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, has similarly suggested that Democrats consider blocking financing for a troop increase, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, vowed Monday ""to take a look at it."" The Kennedy plan is intended to provide Democrats with a road map for how to proceed in Iraq. Mr. Kennedy, as he begins his 45th year in the Senate, recalled that Congress interceded during conflicts in Vietnam and Lebanon, and he said Democrats should not hesitate to do so in Iraq. ""I don't think we should be pulling back any funds,"" said Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who was elected in November. But the House majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, has not endorsed the idea. I don't think so, but that is what's happening, and we have to do everything we can to insist on accountability."" Other Democrats, either looking ahead to a possible presidential candidacy or their own re-elections, have also distanced themselves from such a proposal, fearful of being cast as opposing the troops. Some Democrats are urging an immediate withdrawal of troops and a drastic reduction in war spending. Still other Democrats are waiting for Mr. Bush to present his plan before criticizing it. Still, there is little consensus over how to proceed. Others are calling for a gradual re-deployment of troops to move them out of Iraq. The Democratic Party sailed to victory in midterm elections in the fall on a promise to change course in Iraq. The expectations set by the elections, Democrats say, present a complicating challenge as they begin to govern. Take, for example, Mr. Reid, who said on Dec. 17 that he would support a plan for a temporary increase in increase troops. She said she would oppose a proposal to block money for a troop increase. ""My concern now is that too many Democrats are going to want to play it safe on this issue and not take the strong stand that American people demand,"" he said Monday. By law, Congress can limit the nature of troop deployments, cap the size of military deployments and cut financing for existing or prospective deployments. Two weeks later, he announced his opposition, saying his change had nothing to do with other Democratic senators having spoken out against it, but rather with military officials having disagreed with a call for more troops. The pressure from war critics on the Democratic left has been particularly intense. Since 1970, there have been dozens of occasions in which Congress has tried to step into military action, from Haiti to Bosnia to Kosovo, according to a memorandum being sent Tuesday to lawmakers by the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy group. Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said he believed that his party lost the White House in 2004 because of Iraq. ""The bottom line is that they were elected on a mandate to get the nation out of the mess in Iraq,"" said Eli Pariser, the executive director of MoveOn.org, a liberal political action committee. ""The importance of this legislation is that it will apply now before we could get the escalation,"" he said. ""If there are any risks that our efforts to slash the budget would place them at greater risk, that would be unacceptable to me."" I'm not sure that all of our colleagues in the Senate understand that, quite frankly."" But Democrats who are trying to stop Mr. Bush's proposed troop increase, a group led by Mr. Kennedy, say their proposal to block financing will apply only to new troops.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Brazil's new president doubts prospect of Embraer-Boeing merger,"Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro expressed doubts on Friday over the merger between Brazilian aviation company Embraer and U.S. company Boeing, which has been in talks since last year.
At a press conference at Brasilia's air base held after the inauguration of the new commander of Aeronautics, Bolsonaro said that the latest proposal, presented in December, could affect the interests of Brazilians, but did not go further into detail.
""It's our heritage.
We know of the need of this merger, for its (Embraer's) competitiveness, so it doesn't disappear over time,"" said Bolsonaro, who was sworn in as Brazil's president on Tuesday.
The proposed merger between Embraer and Boeing would include the commercial aviation area of Embraer and associated services, in which Boeing has an 80 percent share and Embraer has 20 percent.
During the final days of former president Michel Temer's government last month, the Finance Ministry was notified of the merger, with a period of 30 days to contest the legality of it.
The legal opinion will be up to the Attorney General's Office of National Treasury, and the government will make a decision on the basis of the opinion.
Although Embraer was privatized in 1994, the Brazilian government owns a special ""golden share"" which gives it veto power on important decisions, such as the transfer of control of the company, interruption to the provision of military aircraft parts, and a change of its name.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Helping refugees proves labor of love in Germany as politics pivots,"BERLIN (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In the light-flooded reception of a community center in east Berlin, Syrians - whose first language is Arabic - practised German, their conversation occasionally punctuated by laughter as they stumbled over a word or mixed up languages.
While they learned, their children were given extra tuition by Back on Track Syria, a social business that helps young refugees and asylum seekers settle in German schools after losing years of education to war.
“I was very afraid for my children.
My daughter was going to school and every day bombs were falling down,” said Shereen Sido Resho from Aleppo, whose two children are being taught by the organization.
She has been in Germany for two years.
“The children come here and they are playing.
They have new friends.
It’s not only about the teaching.
And I like how we are sitting and speaking German together.”
With an influx of more than 1.6 million asylum seekers into Germany since 2014, mainly from the Middle East and Africa, integration is a hot political issue for Chancellor Angela Merkel whose conservatives have lost ground to the far-right.
Hundreds of people have created organizations to help newcomers settle in and build ties, with efforts ranging from sports clubs and music groups that include migrants to recruitment agencies specializing in finding refugees work.
The government has provided grants since 2015 to social enterprises working to help refugees get jobs and integrate.
While some have taken off, others have struggled to find ways to use business, not charity, to solve social problems.
PREJUDICES
Petra Becker started Back on Track Syria in a refugee shelter in 2016, with Syrian teachers she recruited via Facebook giving lessons to 200 children, before moving to two of the city’s cultural centers.
Becker realized that young Syrians needed extra coaching after she struggled to get her own children into Berlin schools when her family returned from Damascus in 2012, where she had been working in the German embassy.
“Lots of headmasters whom I talked to, to get them into German school, had prejudices about the Syrian school system - they didn’t trust that they had enough knowledge to cope with school here,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
“That made me wonder what happened to the children who didn’t speak German.”
But Back on Track Syria runs on a shoestring budget, with scant government funding and no fees from parents.
Although Becker received business advice from a social enterprise accelerator, she still spends half of her time fundraising.
“Whenever we do workshops ... they tell us to take money from the parents, but they don’t have money,” she said.
“And if we did, they wouldn’t send their children anymore.”
She hopes to win a government contract to pay her bilingual volunteers to provide refugee children with the extra support they need to catch up with the curriculum and improve their German within ordinary schools.
But the government is keen to rein in welfare costs as public anger toward migrants helped propel The Alternative for Germany (AfD) into parliament last year - the first far-right group to win seats in more than half a century.
Germany expects to spend around 78 billion euros ($91 billion) on migration-related issues through 2022, with social payments accounting for about 21 billion euros and 13 billion to be spent on language courses and other integrative measures.
Social enterprises struggle to win government contracts, which have traditionally gone to about half a dozen welfare organizations, because many people do not understand what they are, said Markus Sauerhammer, an advocate for the sector.
“A lot of them are between business and welfare organizations - they are a hybrid of both,” said Sauerhammer, who set up the Social Entrepreneurship Network Germany in September, to help start ups grow into successful businesses.
“It’s not so easy to find the right way to finance them.”
About 250 organizations have already joined his network, including Ashoka, a U.S.-headquartered pioneer in the field, and the Social Impact Lab, which mentors and trains social entrepreneurs.
Reliable financing would enable Becker to help more children like 13-year-old Masa Zughbi, who left Idlib, a northern Syrian city close to the Turkish border, in 2013, after it was seized by groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
“I can’t learn in Syria - it’s better for me here,” said Zughbi, who, like many girls her age, struggled to resist the pull of her smartphone as she spoke.
“When I came to school here it was difficult because I couldn’t speak German well and now I am the best in my class in Maths and English.
This was because Back on Track helped me.”","['BERLIN (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In the light-flooded reception of a community center in east Berlin, Syrians - whose first language is Arabic - practised German, their conversation occasionally punctuated by laughter as they stumbled over a word or mixed up languages.'

Reliable financing would enable Becker to help more children like 13-year-old Masa Zughbi, who left Idlib, a northern Syrian city close to the Turkish border, in 2013, after it was seized by groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad. “I can’t learn in Syria - it’s better for me here,” said Zughbi, who, like many girls her age, struggled to resist the pull of her smartphone as she spoke. “When I came to school here it was difficult because I couldn’t speak German well and now I am the best in my class in Maths and English.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Rise in U.S. business equipment orders points to firm investment,"New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in July and growth in shipments held firm, signaling that business investment started the third quarter on a strong note.
The Commerce Department said on Friday orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 1.4 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.9 percent increase in June.
“That provides further reason to think that overall GDP has continued to expand at a healthy ... pace,” said Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics.
Business spending on equipment is being supported by the Trump administration’s $1.5 trillion income tax cut package, which came into effect in January.
But there are worries that trade tensions between the United States and its major trade partners, including China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, could offset the fiscal stimulus.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the so-called core capital goods orders rising 0.4 percent in July after a previously reported 0.2 percent gain in June.
Core capital goods orders increased 7.2 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Shipments of core capital goods rose 0.9 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.9 percent gain in June.
Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government’s gross domestic product measurement, so the higher estimate for shipments in June could contribute to an upward revision of economic growth in the second quarter.
Yields on U.S. government debt rose modestly after the data, with investors awaiting a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
U.S. stocks were trading higher while the dollar .DXY was down against a basket of currencies.
Business investment drove about a quarter of economic growth in the second quarter.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"U.S. Pacific Northwest under-prepared for tsunamis, experts say","The U.S. region most vulnerable to tsunamis - the massive waves of water unleashed by undersea earthquakes - is dangerously under-prepared, experts and officials in Oregon and Washington state said after a magnitude 7.9 earthquake this week.
The quake that struck in the Gulf of Alaska late Monday, triggering a tsunami warning for Alaska and a tsunami watch for the U.S. West Coast, rekindled concerns that a seismic sea wave along the northwest coast could kill, injure or displace tens of thousands of people and cause billions of dollars in damage.
In this week’s quake, the warnings and watches were quickly lifted, and there was no damage from the slight change it caused in the ocean.
But experts worry that in some parts of the region there is too little information about where tsunamis might occur, and in others too much infrastructure built in locations known to face a threat.
“There’s still a lot that needs to be done,” said Corina Forson, Washington’s chief hazards geologist.
Scientists in the state have pinpointed just half the locations where a destructive tsunami triggered by the Cascadia subduction zone off the northwest coast might come ashore, and about 10 percent of sites that might be hit by a wave emanating from the Seattle fault zone, Forson said.
She called the lack of information dangerous.
A tsunami could send a wall of water 50 feet (15 meters) high crashing onto the coast, or a wave 16 feet (5 meters) high into Seattle, the state’s largest city, she said.
“If there’s the real thing and people don’t have evacuation routes and plans, they won’t know where to get to safety and it could be life-threatening,” she said.
In neighboring Oregon, officials have created evacuation plans and public awareness campaigns to help people prepare.
But the state has not done enough to stop people from building in potential danger zones, said Jay Wilson, former chairman of the Oregon Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission.
“There are about 30,000 people who live in the tsunami zones,” Wilson said.
“If we do everything right, they’re going to run up to the top of the hill.
And then they’re all going to be permanently displaced.”
DEADLY THREAT
Parts of Oregon and far northern California have up to a 37 percent chance of a tsunami from a rupture of the Cascadia subduction zone in the next 50 years, said Chris Goldfinger, a tsunami and earthquake expert with the Oregon State University.
Tsunamis are generally produced when tectonic plates move against each other under the ocean in subduction zones, displacing ocean water through powerful quakes.
They have a deadly history.
The 2011 quake and tsunami in Japan killed up to 18,000 people and wrecked Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant, causing the worst meltdown since the Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union.
The 2004 Asian tsunami killed 226,000 people.
A big tsunami on the Oregon coast could kill up to 10,000 people, said Althea Rizzo, the state’s geologic hazards program coordinator.
In recent years, Oregon has instituted practice drills at schools and hospitals, provided evacuation materials to tourists in their hotel rooms and in some areas painted blue evacuation lines to higher ground on roads and paths, Rizzo said.
The city of Seaside, Oregon, voted in 2016 to fund a bond measure to move its schools out of the inundation zone.
There are statewide restrictions on building essential facilities like hospitals in tsunami zones.
But updated maps showing where those zones are located have not been incorporated into the law, meaning the restrictions might not apply in areas that are now known to be dangerous, Wilson said.
“In the Northwest our biggest problem is not getting the word out, it’s that our built infrastructure is very vulnerable,” said Goldfinger.
“Buildings within a tsunami zone are pretty much going to be destroyed.”
California is considering adopting international zoning standards for tsunami zone construction, as well as “blue line” evacuation routes like those in Oregon, said Rick Wilson, senior engineering geologist for the California Geological Survey.
In Manzanita on the Oregon coast, resident Kerry Driscoll said she has an evacuation plan and the cabins at the beachside resort where she works are equipped with pamphlets telling tourists how to prepare.
But tsunamis can come with little warning, and she knows it might be hard to get out.
“If we don’t have major advance warning I don’t think there’s much that we can do,” Driscoll said.
“I can’t see running from giant tidal waves.”","['The U.S. region most vulnerable to tsunamis - the massive waves of water unleashed by undersea earthquakes - is dangerously under-prepared, experts and officials in Oregon and Washington state said after a magnitude 7.9 earthquake this week.'

The quake that struck in the Gulf of Alaska late Monday, triggering a tsunami warning for Alaska and a tsunami watch for the U.S. West Coast, rekindled concerns that a seismic sea wave along the northwest coast could kill, injure or displace tens of thousands of people and cause billions of dollars in damage. In this week’s quake, the warnings and watches were quickly lifted, and there was no damage from the slight change it caused in the ocean. But experts worry that in some parts of the region there is too little information about where tsunamis might occur, and in others too much infrastructure built in locations known to face a threat. “There’s still a lot that needs to be done,” said Corina Forson, Washington’s chief hazards geologist. Scientists in the state have pinpointed just half the locations where a destructive tsunami triggered by the Cascadia subduction zone off the northwest coast might come ashore, and about 10 percent of sites that might be hit by a wave emanating from the Seattle fault zone, Forson said. She called the lack of information dangerous. A tsunami could send a wall of water 50 feet (15 meters) high crashing onto the coast, or a wave 16 feet (5 meters) high into Seattle, the state’s largest city, she said. “If there’s the real thing and people don’t have evacuation routes and plans, they won’t know where to get to safety and it could be life-threatening,” she said.

Parts of Oregon and far northern California have up to a 37 percent chance of a tsunami from a rupture of the Cascadia subduction zone in the next 50 years, said Chris Goldfinger, a tsunami and earthquake expert with the Oregon State University. “In the Northwest our biggest problem is not getting the word out, it’s that our built infrastructure is very vulnerable,” said Goldfinger. “There are about 30,000 people who live in the tsunami zones,” Wilson said. The city of Seaside, Oregon, voted in 2016 to fund a bond measure to move its schools out of the inundation zone. She called the lack of information dangerous. The 2004 Asian tsunami killed 226,000 people. “If we do everything right, they’re going to run up to the top of the hill. Tsunamis are generally produced when tectonic plates move against each other under the ocean in subduction zones, displacing ocean water through powerful quakes. In neighboring Oregon, officials have created evacuation plans and public awareness campaigns to help people prepare. In Manzanita on the Oregon coast, resident Kerry Driscoll said she has an evacuation plan and the cabins at the beachside resort where she works are equipped with pamphlets telling tourists how to prepare. DEADLY THREAT But updated maps showing where those zones are located have not been incorporated into the law, meaning the restrictions might not apply in areas that are now known to be dangerous, Wilson said. A big tsunami on the Oregon coast could kill up to 10,000 people, said Althea Rizzo, the state’s geologic hazards program coordinator. “If we don’t have major advance warning I don’t think there’s much that we can do,” Driscoll said. The quake that struck in the Gulf of Alaska late Monday, triggering a tsunami warning for Alaska and a tsunami watch for the U.S. West Coast, rekindled concerns that a seismic sea wave along the northwest coast could kill, injure or displace tens of thousands of people and cause billions of dollars in damage. And then they’re all going to be permanently displaced.” The 2011 quake and tsunami in Japan killed up to 18,000 people and wrecked Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant, causing the worst meltdown since the Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union. In this week’s quake, the warnings and watches were quickly lifted, and there was no damage from the slight change it caused in the ocean. They have a deadly history. In recent years, Oregon has instituted practice drills at schools and hospitals, provided evacuation materials to tourists in their hotel rooms and in some areas painted blue evacuation lines to higher ground on roads and paths, Rizzo said. But experts worry that in some parts of the region there is too little information about where tsunamis might occur, and in others too much infrastructure built in locations known to face a threat. But tsunamis can come with little warning, and she knows it might be hard to get out. “There’s still a lot that needs to be done,” said Corina Forson, Washington’s chief hazards geologist. California is considering adopting international zoning standards for tsunami zone construction, as well as “blue line” evacuation routes like those in Oregon, said Rick Wilson, senior engineering geologist for the California Geological Survey. “I can’t see running from giant tidal waves.” “If there’s the real thing and people don’t have evacuation routes and plans, they won’t know where to get to safety and it could be life-threatening,” she said. There are statewide restrictions on building essential facilities like hospitals in tsunami zones. The U.S. region most vulnerable to tsunamis - the massive waves of water unleashed by undersea earthquakes - is dangerously under-prepared, experts and officials in Oregon and Washington state said after a magnitude 7.9 earthquake this week. A tsunami could send a wall of water 50 feet (15 meters) high crashing onto the coast, or a wave 16 feet (5 meters) high into Seattle, the state’s largest city, she said.","[0, 2, 1]","[8, 7, 6]"

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"Seven years after tsunami, Japanese live uneasily with seawalls","When a massive earthquake struck in 2011, Japanese oyster fisherman Atsushi Fujita was working as usual by the sea.
Soon after, a huge black wave slammed into his city and killed nearly 2,000 people.
Seven years on, Fujita and thousands like him along Japan’s northeast coast have rebuilt their lives alongside huge sea walls that experts say will protect them if another giant tsunami, which some see as inevitable in a seismically active nation like Japan, was to strike.
The 12.5-meter (41-ft) concrete wall replaced a 4-meter breakwater that was swamped in the March 11, 2011 disaster.
The earthquake and tsunami, which reached as high as 30 meters in some areas, killed nearly 18,000 people across Japan and triggered a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima power plant.
“It feels like we’re in jail, even though we haven’t done anything bad,” the 52-year-old Fujita said.
Since the disaster, some towns have forbidden construction in flat areas nearest the coast and have relocated residents to higher land.
Others, such as Rikuzentakata, have raised the level of their land by several meters before constructing new buildings.
A common thread, though, is the construction of seawalls to replace breakwaters that were overwhelmed by the tsunami.
Some 395 km (245 miles) of walls have been built at a cost of 1.35 trillion yen ($12.74 billion).
“The seawalls will halt tsunamis and prevent them from inundating the land,” said Hiroyasu Kawai, researcher at the Port and Airport Research Institute in Yokosuka, near Tokyo.
“Even if the tsunami is bigger than the wall, the wall will delay flooding and guarantee more time for evacuation.”
ADJUSTING
Many residents initially welcomed the idea of the walls but have become more critical over time.
Some say they were not consulted enough in the planning stages or that money spent on the walls has meant that other rebuilding, such as housing, has fallen behind.
Others worry the walls will damage tourism.
“About 50 years ago, we came up here with the kids and enjoyed drives along the beautiful ocean and bays,” said Reiko Iijima, a tourist from central Japan, who was eating at an oyster restaurant across from the seawall.
“Now, there’s not even a trace of that.”
Part of a wall in the city of Kesennuma, further south, has windows in it - but these, too, draw complaints.
“They’re a parody,” said Yuichiro Ito, who lost his home and younger brother in the tsunami.
“It’s just to keep us happy with something we never wanted in the first place.”
Fisherman Fujita said that while the tsunami had improved oyster farming in the area by stirring up sea floors and removing accumulated sludge, the sea walls could block natural water flows from the land and impact future production.
Many municipalities said the giant walls had to be in place before permission could be granted for reconstruction elsewhere.
“I can’t say things like ‘the wall should be lower’ or ‘we don’t need it,’” said Katsuhiro Hatakeyama, who has rebuilt his bed and breakfast business in the same location as before.
“It’s thanks to the wall that I could rebuild, and now have a job.”
But many find the wall hard to adjust to.
“Everyone here has lived with the sea, through generations,” said Sotaro Usui, head of a tuna supply company.
“The wall keeps us apart - and that’s unbearable.”","['When a massive earthquake struck in 2011, Japanese oyster fisherman Atsushi Fujita was working as usual by the sea.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"Floods kill dozens, displace more than a million in India, Bangladesh","Flash floods triggered by heavy monsoon rains in South Asia have killed dozens of people and displaced more than a million, most in northeast India and Bangladesh, authorities said on Tuesday.
The Brahmaputra river, which flows from the Himalayas down to India and then through Bangladesh, has burst its banks, swamping more than 1,500 villages in India’s Assam state in the past week.
“The flood situation remains critical,” Assam’s Water Resources Minister Keshab Mahanta told Reuters, referring to at least 10 of the state’s 32 districts.
“The weather office is forecasting more rain and thundershowers in the next 48 hours,” Mahanta said, adding that the state was on maximum alert and the army had put helicopters on standby, in case they were needed for rescues.
The floods have killed nearly 20 people and displaced about 800,000 in the Indian states of Assam, Tripura and Manipur.
The water level in the Brahmaputra is expected to rise until the end of the week and then level off, in the absence of more heavy rain, India’s Central Water Commission said.
Downstream in Bangladesh, 11 people have been killed and more than 250,000 have been displaced or affected by the flooding, officials there said.
Last week, landslides and other mishaps triggered by rains killed at least 12 people in southeast Bangladesh, including two Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar living in camps near the border.
The camps, thrown up after an estimated 700,000 Rohingyas fled from a Myanmar military crackdown on insurgents that began last August, are believed to be particularly vulnerable to storms in the rainy season, which has just begun.","['Flash floods triggered by heavy monsoon rains in South Asia have killed dozens of people and displaced more than a million, most in northeast India and Bangladesh, authorities said on Tuesday.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,JUDGE CLEARS PATH FOR DETROIT BANKRUPTCY CASE,"DETROIT - A federal bankruptcy judge on Wednesday cleared the way for Detroit’s bankruptcy case to go forward without legal challenges.
The decision by Judge Steven Rhodes of U.S. Bankruptcy Court freezes all litigation against the city during the bankruptcy process and consolidates state-level legal challenges to Detroit’s Chapter 9 filing into the federal bankruptcy case.
The federal bankruptcy court has “exclusive jurisdiction” over the case, he said, adding, “There is no case law that holds otherwise.”
It was a dramatic beginning to the largest municipal bankruptcy case in American history.
The judge was attempting to put to rest a legal spat that began almost immediately after Detroit filed for bankruptcy last Thursday, the largest American city ever to do so.
On Friday a state judge, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina of Ingham County Circuit Court, ruled that the filing violated the state constitution, which protects the pensions of retired public employees.
The city has been expected to seek reductions in pensions in bankruptcy court as part of its broader efforts to reduce Detroit’s estimated $18 billion in debts and other obligations.
Aquilina’s ruling was appealed by the state attorney general to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which on Tuesday issued a stay of her order pending their appellate decision.
But on Wednesday, in the first hearing on the Chapter 9 case, Rhodes approved a motion by the city’s emergency financial manager, Kevyn D. Orr, to freeze all litigation against the city during the bankruptcy process.
The move effectively gives Rhodes the authority to rule on the issues raised by retired public employees regarding their pensions.
Rhodes also granted a second motion by the emergency manager that extends protection from litigation to Gov.
Rick Snyder of Michigan and other state officials.
Last week, Snyder accepted the city’s emergency manager’s recommendation and ordered Detroit to file for Chapter 9.
Both Snyder and Orr have said that a bankruptcy filing was the only option to settle Detroit’s crushing debt.
As the case began, protesters gathered outside the federal courthouse downtown.","['DETROIT - A federal bankruptcy judge on Wednesday cleared the way for Detroit’s bankruptcy case to go forward without legal challenges.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Bertelsmann targets life-long learning with OnCourse deal,"German publishing group Bertelsmann (BTGGg.F) said on Monday it was buying U.S. online education provider OnCourse Learning from private equity firm CIP Capital in a deal worth around $500 million.
The acquisition backs Bertelsmann’s push into digital education and training, and will boost its presence in the United States, a growth market which already contributes around a fifth of its sales.
“We are expanding our education business to include a company with significant growth potential,” said Bertelsmann’s chairman and CEO, Thomas Rabe.
“At the same time, the transaction will further strengthen our presence in the U.S., where we already generate more than 20 percent of our revenues.
In the future, we expect this share to rise to around 30 percent.”
OnCourse Learning, founded in 2007, is based in Brookfield, Wisconsin, and employs 375 people.
It provides digital corporate and advanced training courses for healthcare and financial services customers and has a smaller real-estate business.
“There’s certainly a significant opportunity for expanding into life-long learning,” Sarah Simon, media analyst at Berenberg, said of the deal.
“We’re all going to have to work for ever, so there’s going to be more demand for people to re-skill themselves and change jobs.”
Bertelsmann is one of the few larger companies to invest in the field, along with U.S. publisher John Wiley (JWa.N), while Britain’s Pearson (PSON.L) is more focused on the school and college segment of the U.S. market, added Simon.
PORTFOLIO RESTRUCTURING
The acquisition is part of Rabe’s strategic push to invest in growth areas - Bertelsmann’s education division achieved revenue growth of 21 percent in the first half of the year, albeit from a small base.
The education division’s top line was just 111 million euros ($129 million) out of total revenues of 8.2 billion euros.
Bertelsmann’s largest business, television broadcaster RTL Group (RRTL.DE), is nearly 30 times bigger.
The publisher - which spans eight divisions - is meanwhile close to selling its Arvato CRM call-centre unit to free up capital to invest in growth projects while strengthening its established units, some of which face headwinds.
OnCourse Learning, which has an online library of around 22,000 courses, is used by around 750,000 people and 19,000 business customers.
The U.S. market for continuing education in healthcare and financial services is estimated at $3.6 billion.
Its healthcare division will be folded into Bertelsmann subsidiary Relias, which was acquired in 2014 and also operates in the industry, Bertelsmann said.
The company also has a stake in Udacity, a life-long learning platform founded by German computer scientist Sebastian Thrun.","['German publishing group Bertelsmann (BTGGg.F) said on Monday it was buying U.S. online education provider OnCourse Learning from private equity firm CIP Capital in a deal worth around $500 million.'

The acquisition is part of Rabe’s strategic push to invest in growth areas - Bertelsmann’s education division achieved revenue growth of 21 percent in the first half of the year, albeit from a small base. “We are expanding our education business to include a company with significant growth potential,” said Bertelsmann’s chairman and CEO, Thomas Rabe. The company also has a stake in Udacity, a life-long learning platform founded by German computer scientist Sebastian Thrun. “There’s certainly a significant opportunity for expanding into life-long learning,” Sarah Simon, media analyst at Berenberg, said of the deal. “We’re all going to have to work for ever, so there’s going to be more demand for people to re-skill themselves and change jobs.” German publishing group Bertelsmann (BTGGg.F) said on Monday it was buying U.S. online education provider OnCourse Learning from private equity firm CIP Capital in a deal worth around $500 million. “At the same time, the transaction will further strengthen our presence in the U.S., where we already generate more than 20 percent of our revenues.","German publishing group Bertelsmann (BTGGg.F) said on Monday it was buying U.S. online education provider OnCourse Learning from private equity firm CIP Capital in a deal worth around $500 million.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,"Brazil is ready to launch small commercial rockets from its space base near the equator as soon as it agrees to safeguard U.S. technology that is dominant in the industry, the Brazilian Air Force officer managing the space program said on Friday.
Brig.
Major Luiz Fernando Aguiar said Brazil wants to get a piece of the $300 billion-a-year space launch business by drawing U.S. companies interested in launching small satellites at a lower cost from the Alcantara base on its north coast.
“The microsatellite market is most attractive today and we are interested in the 50 to 500-kilo niche,” Aguiar told Reuters at the base’s main launch pad.
“We are developing a rocket for microsatellites.
For that this tower is totally ready.”
Space cooperation between the United States and Brazil took a big step forward when they signed a Space Situational Awareness (SSA) agreement last month during a visit to Brasilia by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis.
The accord on sharing real-time tracking data on objects and debris in space is needed to develop a satellite launching business without the risk of collision.
Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) in December visited the Alcantara space center, which is especially attractive to smaller firms, such as Tucson, Arizona-based rocket-maker Vector Launch Inc, because its equatorial location cuts fuel costs by a third allowing heavier payloads.
But Brazil’s plan to become a new hub in the space industry will depend on concluding a technology safeguard agreement (TSA) with the United States to protect sensitive American space launch and satellite technology, Aguiar said.
Without it, no U.S. rocket can blast off from the South American country.
A previous attempt at a U.S.-Brazilian space partnership was scuttled in 2003 when the TSA ran into resistance from the leftist government of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and was thwarted by Brazilian lawmakers.
Aguiar said that agreement floundered because it allowed the U.S. unverified access to the Alcantara base that was not acceptable on sovereignty grounds.
A new Brazilian proposal under consideration by the U.S. government will be more “palatable” to the Brazilian Congress.
The TSA is seen by Washington as opening opportunities for greater cooperation in aerospace and defense between the two countries.
The market for small satellite launches is expected to grow fast in the next few years and the U.S. space industry is keen to see new launch capacity in the world and a quick resolution to the negotiation of the TSA with Brazil.
“Demand for launch services has outstripped supply globally and another launch site is needed.
Because of its location, Alcantara offers advantages no other site in the world provides,” an industry source said.
Aguiar said the government will set up a company called Alada to market the launch site.
He said the Air Force has been in talks with Brazilian aerospace company Embraer SA on how to manage the business going forward.
One possibility, Brazilian Air Force officials said, is a joint venture with Embraer’s satellite company Visiona, which is not part of the planned $4.75 billion tie-up between Boeing and Embraer’s commercial aviation arm.","['Brazil is ready to launch small commercial rockets from its space base near the equator as soon as it agrees to safeguard U.S. technology that is dominant in the industry, the Brazilian Air Force officer managing the space program said on Friday.'

Brig. “The microsatellite market is most attractive today and we are interested in the 50 to 500-kilo niche,” Aguiar told Reuters at the base’s main launch pad. Brazil is ready to launch small commercial rockets from its space base near the equator as soon as it agrees to safeguard U.S. technology that is dominant in the industry, the Brazilian Air Force officer managing the space program said on Friday. The accord on sharing real-time tracking data on objects and debris in space is needed to develop a satellite launching business without the risk of collision. Space cooperation between the United States and Brazil took a big step forward when they signed a Space Situational Awareness (SSA) agreement last month during a visit to Brasilia by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis. “We are developing a rocket for microsatellites. For that this tower is totally ready.” But Brazil’s plan to become a new hub in the space industry will depend on concluding a technology safeguard agreement (TSA) with the United States to protect sensitive American space launch and satellite technology, Aguiar said. A previous attempt at a U.S.-Brazilian space partnership was scuttled in 2003 when the TSA ran into resistance from the leftist government of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and was thwarted by Brazilian lawmakers. Without it, no U.S. rocket can blast off from the South American country. Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) in December visited the Alcantara space center, which is especially attractive to smaller firms, such as Tucson, Arizona-based rocket-maker Vector Launch Inc, because its equatorial location cuts fuel costs by a third allowing heavier payloads. A new Brazilian proposal under consideration by the U.S. government will be more “palatable” to the Brazilian Congress. The TSA is seen by Washington as opening opportunities for greater cooperation in aerospace and defense between the two countries. Aguiar said that agreement floundered because it allowed the U.S. unverified access to the Alcantara base that was not acceptable on sovereignty grounds. The market for small satellite launches is expected to grow fast in the next few years and the U.S. space industry is keen to see new launch capacity in the world and a quick resolution to the negotiation of the TSA with Brazil. He said the Air Force has been in talks with Brazilian aerospace company Embraer SA on how to manage the business going forward. Aguiar said the government will set up a company called Alada to market the launch site. One possibility, Brazilian Air Force officials said, is a joint venture with Embraer’s satellite company Visiona, which is not part of the planned $4.75 billion tie-up between Boeing and Embraer’s commercial aviation arm. Because of its location, Alcantara offers advantages no other site in the world provides,” an industry source said. “Demand for launch services has outstripped supply globally and another launch site is needed.","[1, 0, 2]","[8, 7, 6]"
Generate a news article for the following headline.,Volkswagen to end production of the Beetle next year,"Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) said on Thursday it would stop producing its Beetle compact car in 2019, ending a model that looked backward to the 1960s counterculture as the automaker prepares for a leap toward a future of mass-market electric cars.
The original VW Beetle, developed in the 1930s, made a journey from a product identified with Adolf Hitler to a symbol of Germany’s rebirth as a democratic, industrial powerhouse after World War Two.
In the 1960s, the Beetle was a small-is-beautiful icon of the postwar baby boom generation.
Volkswagen discontinued U.S. sales of the “bug” in 1979, but continued production for Mexico and Latin America.
In the mid-1990s, at a time when Volkswagen was struggling to rekindle sales in the United States, then-Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech pushed to revive and modernize the distinctive Beetle design pioneered by his grandfather, Ferdinand Porsche.
The result was a crescent-shaped car called the “New Beetle,” launched in 1998, which offered playful touches such as a built-in flower vase.
The New Beetle was a hit during its early years, with sales of more than 80,000 in the United States in 1999, but recently the car’s U.S. sales have suffered along with most other small cars.
Overall, VW has sold about 500,000 Beetles globally since 1998, the company said.
Volkswagen sold a total of 11,151 Beetles in the United States through the first eight months of 2018, down 2.2 percent from the same period a year earlier.
U.S. consumers looking for a small Volkswagen vehicle overwhelmingly prefer the Jetta sedan, or a Tiguan compact sport utility vehicle.
The Jetta, Tiguan and Beetle are built for North America and other markets at a factory in Mexico.
The end of the Beetle comes at a turning point for Volkswagen.
The German automaker’s last three years have been rocked by the fallout from a scandal caused by its admitted cheating on diesel emissions tests.
Now, Volkswagen is gearing up to launch a wave of electric vehicles to appeal to a new generation of environmentally conscious consumers - children and grandchildren of the 1960s Beetle enthusiasts.
In a statement announcing the end of the Beetle, Hinrich Woebcken, head of Volkswagen of America, said that as the company ramps up its electrification strategy, there are no plans to replace the Beetle.
However, his statement did not rule that out someday.
He noted the company’s I.D.
Buzz, a prototype for a 21st Century reincarnation of the microbus.
The automaker has said it intends to put a vehicle similar to the I.D.
Buzz into production as an electric vehicle.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Heavy Rains Set Off Flooding in Southern China,"Torrential rains in southern China have unleashed surging floodwaters that have swept through small cities and farming villages, claiming at least 66 lives, forcing nearly 600,000 people to be relocated and destroying millions of dollars in property, the state news media reported Sunday.
Rescue efforts were under way in the southern provinces of Hunan, Guizhou, Guangdong and Guangxi, as the floodwaters swept through mountainous regions prone to landslides.
Nearly nine million people were directly affected by the flooding, and factories and other enterprises have been closed in some areas, according to Xinhua, China's official news agency.
Heavy rains began last Wednesday in southern China and deluged the region into the weekend.
By Sunday, the rains had subsided in Guangxi Province, but more flooding was possible as water levels in local rivers were expected to keep rising for several days.
Guangxi had reported eight deaths as well as extensive property damage, including the destruction of more than 3,700 homes and thousands of acres of cropland.
Flooding is an annual early summer event in southern China and a reminder of the country's contradictory weather patterns.
Even as the south is awash in floodwaters, other regions of China are gripped by record drought.
In the southwestern corner of Sichuan Province, drought is so severe that trucks are delivering emergency water supplies.
Major cities along the southern coast, including the manufacturing export centers in Guangdong Province, were not reporting any flooding problems.
But water was chest high in other parts of the province, including Zi Jin County, where some towns were experiencing the worst flooding in 50 years.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Factbox: U.S. stocks to watch as Hurricane Florence approaches,"Stocks in weather-sensitive industries reacted as Hurricane Florence moved closer to the U.S. East Coast on Monday.
Shares of roofing and insulation products companies including Beacon Roofing Supply Inc (BECN.O) and Owens Corning (OC.N) rose, while insurers such as Allstate Corp (ALL.N) tumbled.
Florence, the first major hurricane to threaten the eastern United States this year, was forecast to hit the coast of North Carolina or South Carolina on Thursday.
North Carolina ordered residents to evacuate the state’s Outer Banks barrier islands, and the governors of Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina declared states of emergency.
The Atlantic hurricane season, which typically runs from June to November, caused more than $250 billion worth of damage in the United States in 2017.
But several industries benefited.
Car rental and hotel companies saw an influx of customers, while freight companies commanded higher prices as capacity tightened due to increased demand for supplies in areas struck by hurricanes.
Here is a summary of how shares are performing as Hurricane Florence approaches:
BUILDING SUPPLIES
Hurricane Florence had a mixed effect on building products companies.
Shares of roofing and insulation companies climbed, while those of cement companies fell.
On Monday, shares of Beacon Roofing rose 8.2 percent, their biggest one-day percentage jump in more than a year.
Owens Corning shares rose 3.7 percent and were the top gainers on the PHLX Housing Index .HGX.
Shares of generator maker Generac Holdings Inc (GNRC.N) also touched a four-year high and were last up 5.6 percent.
But Summit Materials Inc (SUM.N) shares fell 8.1 percent after the cement and concrete supplier warned of adverse weather, including Hurricane Florence, hurting performance in several of its markets.
The shares of peer companies Martin Marietta Materials Inc (MLM.N), Vulcan Materials Co (VMC.N) and Eagle Materials Inc (EXP.N) also declined between 2 percent and 3.5 percent.
HOME IMPROVEMENT
Shares of Lowe’s Companies Inc (LOW.N) and Home Depot hit record highs on Monday.
Lowe’s shares were last trading 2.2 percent higher, while Home Depot shares were up 2.6 percent.
During the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Home Depot shares rose 16.3 percent.
But Lowe’s shares only rose 4.7 percent during that period, lagging the S&P 500, as the chain struggled to compete with Home Depot.
INSURANCE
Allstate shares fell 1.9 percent on Monday.
The insurer had a 10.5 percent market share in South Carolina and a 6.6 percent market share in North Carolina, according to Sandler O’Neill.

USA Truck shares advanced 3.8 percent, J B Hunt gained 3.7 percent and Old Dominion added 1.6 percent.

Shares of Marriott International Inc (MAR.O), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) and Choice Hotels International Inc (CHH.N) rose up to 18.9 percent.","['Stocks in weather-sensitive industries reacted as Hurricane Florence moved closer to the U.S. East Coast on Monday.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,'Whitey' Bulger partner ties ex-New England mob boss to 1993 murder,"The ex-partner of convicted Boston gangster James “Whitey” Bulger testified on Thursday that he witnessed the strangling of a nightclub manager who died in 1993 as the former boss of the New England mafia watched.
Stephen “The Rifleman” Flemmi, who is serving a life sentence for 10 murders, told jurors in federal court in Boston that he saw Francis “Cadillac Frank” Salemme’s son strangle Steven DiSarro as his father watched.
Flemmi delivered the testimony during his second day on the stand as the star witness in Salemme’s murder trial.
Salemme, who has confessed to eight other murders, denies killing DiSarro.
Flemmi said he saw the incident after Salemme, who headed the New England family of La Costa Nostra, in an earlier conversation expressed concerns that DiSarro was speaking to authorities and might implicate him in criminal activities.
“Did you obtain impression about Mr. DiSarro’s fate?” Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Wyshak asked.
“Oh yes, Frank wanted to kill him,” Flemmi said.
Flemmi, 83, said he witnessed the strangling when on May 10, 1993, he went to Salemme’s home to talk to Salemme, 84, who he had known and worked with since the 1960s.
He said that he saw Frank Salemme Jr in the kitchen strangling DiSarro as Paul Weadick, an associate also on trial, held his legs and the senior Salemme watched.
Weadick also denies killing Salemme.
Concerned Salemme might be under surveillance, Flemmi said that he quickly left.
But he said Salemme later told him DiSarro was killed and that his body was buried in a 20-foot deep hole at a Rhode Island construction site.
The testimony by Flemmi, who has been cooperating with authorities, provided a flashback to an era when organized crime in Boston was run by Salemme and Bulger, the notorious gangster now serving life in prison.
Flemmi, who also testified against Bulger at his 2013 trial, said he last saw Salemme while in jail in 1999.
On Wednesday, Flemmi said he did not recognize Salemme in the courtroom even though he was sitting nearby.
“I would recognize him if I see him, but I don’t see him,” Flemmi said.
According to prosecutors, Salemme had a secret interest in a music venue called The Channel, which DiSarro had purchased.
In 1993, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent told DiSarro he would be indicted and should cooperate with authorities who were probing Salemme and his son, who died in 1995, prosecutors have said.
Authorities found his body in 2016 behind a mill in Providence, Rhode Island.","['The ex-partner of convicted Boston gangster James “Whitey” Bulger testified on Thursday that he witnessed the strangling of a nightclub manager who died in 1993 as the former boss of the New England mafia watched.'

Flemmi delivered the testimony during his second day on the stand as the star witness in Salemme’s murder trial. Salemme, who has confessed to eight other murders, denies killing DiSarro.

But he said Salemme later told him DiSarro was killed and that his body was buried in a 20-foot deep hole at a Rhode Island construction site.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,U.S. lawmaker asks for public intelligence report on Khashoggi's death,"A senior U.S. senator on Monday called on the U.S. intelligence community to issue a public assessment report on the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
CIA chief Gina Haspel and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats should ""come out and provide the American people and the Congress with a public assessment of who ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi,"" Ron Wyden, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was quoted by U.S. political media The Hill as saying in a statement.
Wyden, a democrat from the state of Oregon, also repeated his demand in a tweet later in the day, calling on the U.S. intelligence leaders to ""provide a public assessment"" over the death of Khashoggi.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said the U.S. full report over the death of Khashoggi would come in the next two days.
While Turmp described the coming CIA report as ""a very premature"" one, U.S. media, citing insiders, reported on Friday that the CIA has concluded that the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman had ordered to kill Khashoggi.
It was not clear if the report will be made public.
Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post, has been missing since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
The Saudi authorities said that Khashoggi died in a ""brawl"" in its consulate.
After releasing the results of its initial investigation, the Saudi Public Prosecution announced that 18 people were arrested for their alleged connections with the killing.
U.S. Congress has urged a thorough investigation of the case, and threatened to take more actions against Saudi Arabia if those responsible were not held accountable, such as suspending U.S. military sales.","['A senior U.S. senator on Monday called on the U.S. intelligence community to issue a public assessment report on the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"Bavarian governor blames ""grand coalition"" for CSU slump in polls","Markus Soeder (CSU), the governor of Bavaria, has blamed infighting in the ruling ""grand coalition"" for the current weakness of his Christian Social Union (CSU) party in opinion polls during a televised appearance on Friday.
""These are all numbers which are incredibly influenced by politics in Berlin,"" Soeder said with view to the latest Infratest dimap survey in which the CSU's voter support has slumped to 33 percent in its Bavarian homestead.
He warned voters not to treat regional elections in his state as an opportunity to punish the federal government.
The CSU, the conservative sister party of chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), has traditionally dominated politics in Bavaria by defending an absolute legislative majority there throughout most of the post-war period.
When polled in an Infratest dimap survey published on Thursday night, however, only 23 percent of voters said they wanted the CSU to continue ruling alone following an upcoming vote on Oct. 14.
According to the survey, it would theoretically even be possible for the Free Democratic Party (FDP), Greens (Gruene), German Social Democrats (SPD) and Left Party (Linke) to form a government together without any participation of the incumbent.
Responding to the poll, Soeder urged Bavarian voters to ""reconsider for two seconds"" before casting their ballot in less than two weeks.
""A game of a few seconds can become a five-year result.""
For Soeder, the deterioration of his party's regional ratings reflected growing voter dissatisfaction with the ""grand coalition"" formed by the CDU, CSU and SPD on a federal level.
""Internal fights are always damaging, no matter who starts them,"" the governor said.
Soeder's party chief Horst Seehofer acts as the interior minister in the federal government and is himself seen as the foremost cause of cabinet dissent by most voters according to recent polls.
Commenting on the latest confrontation between Seehofer, Merkel and the SPD over his defense of the controversial ex-intelligence chief Hans-Georg Maassen, Soeder said that there was still room for improvement in the work of the ""grand coalition"".
At the same time, Soeder vowed that there would be ""zero cooperation"" between the CSU and Alternative for Germany (AfD) to preserve its rule in Bavaria.
The wealthy south eastern region is the only of Germany's 16 federal states where the CSU participates in electoral competitions.
In spite of the CSU downward trend in polls, Soeder insisted that the party had done well by Bavarians while in power.","['Markus Soeder (CSU), the governor of Bavaria, has blamed infighting in the ruling ""grand coalition"" for the current weakness of his Christian Social Union (CSU) party in opinion polls during a televised appearance on Friday.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"STATE LAW STOPPED GUNMAN FROM BUYING ASSAULT RIFLE, OFFICIALS SAY","WASHINGTON - The gunman who killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday test fired an AR-15 assault rifle at a Virginia gun store last week and tried to buy one but was prevented from doing so because Virginia state law prohibits the sale of such weapons to out-of-state buyers, according to two senior law enforcement officials.
Instead, the gunman, Aaron Alexis of Texas, bought a law-enforcement-style shotgun - an 870 Remington pump - and used it Monday as he rampaged through the Navy facility, said the officials, who requested anonymity because of the continuing investigation.
“The gun was broken in half, and he had it in a bag,” one official said of the Remington.
“He went inside the building and assembled it in a bathroom.”
The gunman then perched himself above an atrium where he fired down on people who had been eating breakfast.
He used shotgun shells that had roughly a dozen large ball-bearing-like shots in them, increasing the lethal nature of each shot.
“When he discharged, the pieces of lead would spread the farther they went,” the official said.
“It is similar to weapons used in bird shooting but on a more serious scale.
These were not bullets but many small pieces of lead flying through the air.”
After firing down on the people, the gunman began to search for more people to shoot, according to the law enforcement officials.
As he searched, he was confronted by a security guard near an exit.
The gunman shot the security guard and took his semiautomatic handgun, then headed back to atrium.
“He runs back upstairs and cranks off more rounds with the handgun and then heads to another stairwell where he confronts a worker there and shoots him,” one of the officials said.
The gunman is believed to have shot the Navy employee, who worked in maintenance, with the pistol near another exit.
The most recent account from the law enforcement officials was based on hundreds of interviews that investigators conducted over the past day and hours of video footage analyzed by FBI agents and analysts.
Despite statements from senior law enforcement officials Monday that an AR-15 had been found at the scene, no such gun has been found, and the authorities say they do not believe the gunman used one.
It is unclear if Alexis’ psychiatric issues ever progressed to the point that he was involuntarily committed to a mental health institution, or determined officially to be mentally ill, either of which would have barred him from purchasing a gun.
If neither applied - and most people who are treated for mental illness never get to that point - then his situation would be similar to other mass shooters, like Jared L. Loughner, who killed six people and wounded 12, including former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, in Tucson, Ariz., in 2011, and James E. Holmes, who killed 12 people and wounded dozens of others in a Colorado movie theater in 2012.
Mental health experts point out that the vast majority of people with mental illness are never violent.
On the other hand, studies have found an increased risk for violence among those with serious mental illness, including schizophrenia, major depression or bipolar disorder.","['WASHINGTON - The gunman who killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday test fired an AR-15 assault rifle at a Virginia gun store last week and tried to buy one but was prevented from doing so because Virginia state law prohibits the sale of such weapons to out-of-state buyers, according to two senior law enforcement officials.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,VALEANT TO BUY BAUSCH &amp; LOMB FOR $8.7 BILLION,"Bausch & Lomb, the eye care company, agreed Monday to sell itself to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International of Canada for about $8.7 billion, sidestepping the lengthier process of an initial public offering.
Under the terms of the deal, Valeant will pay $4.5 billion to the investor group that owns Bausch & Lomb, led by the private equity firm Warburg Pincus.
It will also spend about $4.2 billion to repay Bausch & Lomb’s debt.
The deal continues the flurry of deal-making in the health care industry, as companies seek to buy the growth they are hard-pressed to generate on their own.
Announced merger volume in the sector this year is up 14 percent from the period a year earlier, even as takeovers have fallen 8 percent.
Valeant, which is based in Laval, Quebec, has made acquisitions a core part of its growth strategy.
The Bausch & Lomb deal is the company’s biggest yet, over three times larger than the $2.6 billion purchase of the skin care company Medicis Pharmaceutical last year.
Adding Bausch & Lomb, a giant maker of contact lens solution and surgical devices, will significantly bolster Valeant’s offerings in the sector.
Bausch & Lomb will absorb its new parent’s existing ophthalmology operations, creating a business that is expected to generate over $3.5 billion in net revenue this year.
“We believe it’s a great move for the company,” J. Michael Pearson, Valeant’s chief executive, said in an interview by phone.
“There’s an opportunity for a lot of singles and doubles here.”
The takeover also means a tidy payday for Warburg Pincus, which led a $4.5 billion leveraged buyout of Bausch & Lomb in 2007.
The firm already benefited from a $772 million special dividend Bausch & Lomb paid out in March, the bulk of which went to its controlling investor group.
Through the deal, Warburg Pincus is expected to reap a return of as much as three times its original investment, according to a person briefed on the matter.
Warburg Pincus had begun exploring a sale or initial public offering for Bausch & Lomb late last year, and held preliminary talks with a number of potential bidders.
Among them was Valeant, though Pearson said that at the time he and his board could not justify paying the more than $10 billion Warburg Pincus was seeking.
Instead, Bausch & Lomb filed for an initial public offering in March.
Until last month, Valeant was pursuing a takeover of a different company, the generic drugmaker Actavis, in what would have been a deal worth over $13 billion.
When those talks collapsed, Valeant then pivoted to Bausch & Lomb.
Pearson said the bulk of the work on Monday’s transaction took place over last week, with much of the initial due diligence having been completed already.
Though Valeant’s offer was lower than the valuation Bausch & Lomb would have fetched in an initial offering, it allowed Warburg Pincus to exit its investment quickly.
Taking the eye care company public would have meant a more gradual sale over two to three years.
The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter, pending regulatory approval.
Pearson said that while integrating Bausch & Lomb would take some time, Valeant will continue to pursue what he described as smaller “tuck in” acquisitions.
But deal-making will remain a core part of the company’s growth plans.
“Our strategy is our strategy,” he said.
“Our aspiration is to become the most valuable pharmaceutical company in the world.”","['Bausch & Lomb, the eye care company, agreed Monday to sell itself to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International of Canada for about $8.7 billion, sidestepping the lengthier process of an initial public offering.'

 'The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter, pending regulatory approval.']","The deal continues the flurry of deal-making in the health care industry, as companies seek to buy the growth they are hard-pressed to generate on their own. Under the terms of the deal, Valeant will pay $4.5 billion to the investor group that owns Bausch & Lomb, led by the private equity firm Warburg Pincus. It will also spend about $4.2 billion to repay Bausch & Lomb’s debt. Announced merger volume in the sector this year is up 14 percent from the period a year earlier, even as takeovers have fallen 8 percent. Bausch & Lomb, the eye care company, agreed Monday to sell itself to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International of Canada for about $8.7 billion, sidestepping the lengthier process of an initial public offering. Valeant, which is based in Laval, Quebec, has made acquisitions a core part of its growth strategy. “We believe it’s a great move for the company,” J. Michael Pearson, Valeant’s chief executive, said in an interview by phone. Bausch & Lomb will absorb its new parent’s existing ophthalmology operations, creating a business that is expected to generate over $3.5 billion in net revenue this year. The Bausch & Lomb deal is the company’s biggest yet, over three times larger than the $2.6 billion purchase of the skin care company Medicis Pharmaceutical last year. “There’s an opportunity for a lot of singles and doubles here.” Adding Bausch & Lomb, a giant maker of contact lens solution and surgical devices, will significantly bolster Valeant’s offerings in the sector. Warburg Pincus had begun exploring a sale or initial public offering for Bausch & Lomb late last year, and held preliminary talks with a number of potential bidders. The firm already benefited from a $772 million special dividend Bausch & Lomb paid out in March, the bulk of which went to its controlling investor group. Through the deal, Warburg Pincus is expected to reap a return of as much as three times its original investment, according to a person briefed on the matter. The takeover also means a tidy payday for Warburg Pincus, which led a $4.5 billion leveraged buyout of Bausch & Lomb in 2007. Among them was Valeant, though Pearson said that at the time he and his board could not justify paying the more than $10 billion Warburg Pincus was seeking. Until last month, Valeant was pursuing a takeover of a different company, the generic drugmaker Actavis, in what would have been a deal worth over $13 billion. When those talks collapsed, Valeant then pivoted to Bausch & Lomb. Pearson said the bulk of the work on Monday’s transaction took place over last week, with much of the initial due diligence having been completed already. Though Valeant’s offer was lower than the valuation Bausch & Lomb would have fetched in an initial offering, it allowed Warburg Pincus to exit its investment quickly. Instead, Bausch & Lomb filed for an initial public offering in March. “Our aspiration is to become the most valuable pharmaceutical company in the world.” But deal-making will remain a core part of the company’s growth plans. Pearson said that while integrating Bausch & Lomb would take some time, Valeant will continue to pursue what he described as smaller “tuck in” acquisitions. Taking the eye care company public would have meant a more gradual sale over two to three years. “Our strategy is our strategy,” he said.

The 2012 Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor failed to win the Utah Republican Party’s nomination, which means he must face 11 challengers in a June primary for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch.
Romney needed at least 60 percent of the votes from delegates at the Utah GOP convention Saturday to head to the November election unopposed, but he earned only 49.12 percent, CNN and other media reported.
Romney was considered the political favorite by political observers and U.S. President Donald Trump endorsed Romney in February.
The president said on Twitter in February that Romney “will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch, and has my full support and endorsement!”
But Romney and the president have not always been political allies.
Romney excoriated Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign and said he was a “fraud” who was “playing the American public for suckers.” Trump responded that Romney had “choked like a dog” in his 2012 campaign against President Barack Obama.
Despite the criticism, Trump briefly considered making Romney his Secretary of State.
Romney said in February that he generally approves of Trump’s agenda, but would call out the president if needed.
“I’m with the president’s domestic policy agenda of low taxes, low regulation, smaller government, pushing back against the bureaucrats,” Romney said.
“I’m not always with the president on what he might say or do, and if that happens I’ll call them like I see them, the way I have in the past.”
Romney was criticized by some delegates for being a latecomer to the state, moving to Utah relatively recently, CNN reported.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,FAMILY PLANNING OFFICIALS INVESTIGATE CHINESE FILM DIRECTOR,"BEIJING – China’s most celebrated film director, Zhang Yimou, is being investigated for a potential violation of family planning laws, an official said Thursday, confirming reports in state news media.
Family planning officials are examining discussions on the Internet that say Zhang has fathered up to seven children with four women.
If he is found to have violated the laws, he could be fined nearly $27 million because the fines are based on the offender’s income, according to a report in the online edition of People’s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party.
An official in a propaganda office attached to the family planning committee of Jiangsu province, near Shanghai on the east coast, confirmed the substance of the People’s Daily report, which was published Wednesday.
Calls to the family planning committee of Wuxi, the city where Chen Ting, Zhang’s second wife, is registered as a resident, went unanswered Thursday.
Family planning laws generally restrict families to one child, and fines are levied for additional children.
There are numerous exceptions, though: Many rural families and ethnic minorities are allowed to have more than one child without penalty.
Xinhua, the state news agency, said Thursday that the local family planning committee would release the results of its investigation into Zhang soon.
Zhang’s most recent feature film was “The Flowers of War” starring Christian Bale; China entered it into the Oscar contest for best foreign film of 2011.
Early in his career, Zhang made a string of films that became popular on the international film festival circuit and in foreign art theaters, including “Red Sorghum,” “Raise the Red Lantern” and “To Live,” adaptations of well-known literary works.
He achieved commercial success with “Hero,” a martial arts film, and was commissioned by Communist Party leaders to direct the opening ceremony of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.
Zhang, 61, is a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, a sort of honorary legislature whose seats are often distributed by the party as political rewards.
Zhang’s critics say he has changed over the years from a director with an uncompromising vision to one who bows to the whims of party officials.
In an interview in Beijing with The New York Times published in 2012, Zhang said censorship “can’t be changed, and it will be there in the future.” He added: “Foreigners think that because I did the opening ceremony of the Olympics, I have certain privileges, but in fact it’s not like that at all.
In front of censorship, everyone is equal.”
Zhang could not be reached for comment Thursday.
There has been a recent push by scholars to end the one-child policy, which critics say has led to forced abortions and sterilizations.
Some economists say that China will face a dwindling pool of young workers in the coming years, and that it no longer makes sense to continue the policy.
Furthermore, for economic reasons, the birthrate is falling across China, especially in urban areas.
There is no reliable public report that gives the exact number of children Zhang has with Chen, an actress.
The recent surge of interest among Chinese Internet users in Zhang’s children appeared to have begun Monday, when Southern Entertainment Weekly published an article that said the couple had two sons and a daughter.
That assertion has not been independently confirmed and the article did not name the sources of the information.
The reporter and a photographer camped outside Zhang’s many homes in Beijing, and the photographer followed a car of his to the airport and witnessed what appeared to be some family members emerging from the car, the article said.
Zhang has a daughter with his first wife, Xiao Hua, whom he divorced around the time he was in a relationship with Gong Li, who starred in Zhang’s early films and became China’s best-known actress.
The daughter, Zhang Mo, is about 30 and studied filmmaking at New York University.
She has worked as a film editor for her father and was a translator for Bale on the set of “The Flowers of War.”
The People’s Daily report said there was speculation that Zhang may have three other children with two other women, but it did not give their identities.","['BEIJING – China’s most celebrated film director, Zhang Yimou, is being investigated for a potential violation of family planning laws, an official said Thursday, confirming reports in state news media.'

The police said the four were involved in a car bomb attack on March 24 in the northern province of Alexandria that killed two policemen and wounded at least four others.
A day after the blast, which failed to harm Alexandria security chief, the police announced killing six of Hasm group militants and said they were involved in the terror operation.

Terror activities in Egypt have killed hundreds of policemen, soldiers and civilians since the military toppled Morsi in July 2013 in response to mass protests against his one-year rule and his Brotherhood group.
The Sinai-based branch of the Islamic State (IS) regional terrorist group claimed responsibility for most of the terror operations in Egypt over the past few years.

A day after the blast, which failed to harm Alexandria security chief, the police announced killing six of Hasm group militants and said they were involved in the terror operation. The police refers to Hasm group as the armed wing of the currently outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group of former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi. Hasm appeared in late 2016 and claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks that killed policemen in the country. Terror activities in Egypt have killed hundreds of policemen, soldiers and civilians since the military toppled Morsi in July 2013 in response to mass protests against his one-year rule and his Brotherhood group. Meanwhile, the Egyptian forces killed hundreds of terrorists and arrested thousands of suspects during the country's anti-terror war declared by President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the army chief then, following Morsi's ouster. The Sinai-based branch of the Islamic State (IS) regional terrorist group claimed responsibility for most of the terror operations in Egypt over the past few years.","[0, 1, 2]","[7, 8, 9]"
Generate a news article for the following headline.,Maldives accuses U.S. of intimidation after comments on political prisoners,"Maldives accused the United States of intimidation on Friday, a day after Washington called for the release of “falsely accused” political prisoners and threatened action if the island’s upcoming election is not free and fair.
Maldives is due to hold a presidential election on Sept. 23 when incumbent Abdulla Yameen will seek a second five-year term.
Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman at the U.S. State Department, said in a statement released on Thursday that the United States was concerned about continued “democratic backsliding in Maldives” ahead of the vote.
“We join the international community in calling for the release of falsely accused political prisoners; full implementation of the Maldivian Supreme Court’s February ruling overturning the convictions of opposition members; an end to executive interference in the Parliament and judiciary ...” Nauert said.
“Absent Maldives’ return to a democratic path, the United States will consider appropriate measures against those individuals who undermine democracy, the rule of law, and a free and fair electoral process,” she said.
The Maldives’ foreign ministry said on Friday that the United States’ call for the release of ‘falsely accused political prisoners’ was seen as “an act of intimidation” and imposing undue influence on the democratic processes of a sovereign state before a key poll.
It urged the United States to allow the Maldivians to freely decide who should lead them on Sept. 23 for the next five years.
“It should be noted that the Maldives has no political prisoners, and all those who have been convicted have undergone due process,” it said in a statement.
The Indian Ocean tourist island has been beset by political instability since a police mutiny forced its first democratically elected leader, Mohamed Nasheed, to quit in 2012.
President Yameen imposed a state of emergency earlier this year, since lifted, to annul a Feb. 1 Supreme Court ruling that quashed convictions against nine opposition leaders and that ordered his government to free those held in prison.
His government has rejected repeated requests by the United Nations, rights groups, and the West to release the president’s rivals and follow fair legal procedures.
The European Union in July warned of possible sanctions ranging from travel bans to asset freezes against those in the Maldives responsible for human rights violations and undermining the rule of law.
In the election, Yameen will be challenged by veteran lawmaker Ibrahim “Ibu” Mohamed Solih representing the opposition Democratic Party after former president Nasheed, who now lives in exile in Sri Lanka, withdrew as a candidate after the national election commission ruled him ineligible to run.","['Maldives accused the United States of intimidation on Friday, a day after Washington called for the release of “falsely accused” political prisoners and threatened action if the island’s upcoming election is not free and fair.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,EX-PRESIDENT OF GUATEMALA IS SENT TO U.S. TO FACE TRIAL,"MEXICO CITY - Guatemalan officials rousted an imprisoned former president Friday and put him on a plane to the U.S. to face long-pending corruption charges.
The extradition of the former president, Alfonso Portillo, who had fought being sent to the U.S. for two years, caught much of Guatemala by surprise and came amid complaints about the country’s willingness to attack impunity among elites.
The extradition followed a high court decision this week to annul a genocide verdict against a former dictator, Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt, who had been convicted of trying to annihilate an indigenous group during Guatemala’s nearly four-decade civil war, which ended in 1996.
On Monday the court found procedural problems in the trial and ruled that part of it must be repeated.
Portillo, who was president from 2000 to 2004, faces charges in U.S. court in New York of conspiring to launder about $70 million of his country’s funds through U.S. banks.
As police officers put him on a plane, swarmed by reporters, Portillo said he was being “kidnapped” and predicted that he would be back when the case fell apart.
After leaving office, he worked in Mexico as a financial adviser until he was extradited to Guatemala in 2008 to face embezzlement charges.
In 2010, the U.S. filed its own charges against him for what a prosecutor called “converting the office of the Guatemalan presidency into his personal ATM.”
The following year, he was acquitted in the Guatemala case, but the U.S. continued to push for his prosecution.
He has been held in prison and in a military hospital, where he was treated for liver and heart ailments.
He was flown to the U.S. in an air ambulance.
On Friday morning the interior minister authorized his transfer, a decision that the U.S. Embassy called “an important affirmation of the rule of law and due process.”
The timing stirred skepticism among analysts, coming as international criticism of the justice system had grown after the erratic course of the Ríos Montt case.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,UN chief hails progress on peacebuilding in Colombia,"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday hailed the progress on peacebuilding in Colombia between the government and the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) on the occasion of the second anniversary of their peace agreement.
Guterres congratulated the people of Colombia and saw the 2016 peace agreement as ""a watershed for the country and an inspiration for all those striving to end deadly conflict around the world through negotiations,"" said Guterres' press office in a statement.
After more than five decades of fighting, insurgents have set aside violence for politics; elections have been the most peaceful in decades; innovative institutions of transitional justice are up and running, and plans have been crafted through broad participation to extend development to remote, conflict-affected regions, said the statement.
Hard work remains to be done to consolidate these early gains of peace, it said.
""The secretary-general is convinced that this goal can be achieved through a concerted effort involving the government and state institutions, political parties, the private sector and civil society, with the accompaniment of the international community.""
The statement voiced strong support of the United Nations for the Colombian people's efforts to preserve sustainable peace.
The Colombian government under then President Juan Manuel Santos secured a peace agreement with FARC rebels in November 2016 after four years of negotiations mostly in Havana, Cuba.
The United Nations has a Verification Mission in Colombia to watch the reintegration of FARC fighters into political, economic and social life and their personal and collective security.
The UN Verification Mission succeeded in September 2017 a UN mission of unarmed observers to monitor and verify the cease-fire between the Colombian government and FARC.","['UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday hailed the progress on peacebuilding in Colombia between the government and the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) on the occasion of the second anniversary of their peace agreement.'

After more than five decades of fighting, insurgents have set aside violence for politics; elections have been the most peaceful in decades; innovative institutions of transitional justice are up and running, and plans have been crafted through broad participation to extend development to remote, conflict-affected regions, said the statement. ""The secretary-general is convinced that this goal can be achieved through a concerted effort involving the government and state institutions, political parties, the private sector and civil society, with the accompaniment of the international community."" The statement voiced strong support of the United Nations for the Colombian people's efforts to preserve sustainable peace. The Colombian government under then President Juan Manuel Santos secured a peace agreement with FARC rebels in November 2016 after four years of negotiations mostly in Havana, Cuba. The UN Verification Mission succeeded in September 2017 a UN mission of unarmed observers to monitor and verify the cease-fire between the Colombian government and FARC. The United Nations has a Verification Mission in Colombia to watch the reintegration of FARC fighters into political, economic and social life and their personal and collective security.","UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday hailed the progress on peacebuilding in Colombia between the government and the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) on the occasion of the second anniversary of their peace agreement.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,EU regulators want to know if merchants hurt by Amazon copies,"EU antitrust regulators are asking retailers and manufacturers whether Amazon’s (AMZN.O) sales of own brand products similar to theirs have harmed their business, a move which could lead to a formal case and possibly fines against the U.S. tech giant.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said last week she was looking into whether the world’s largest online retailer was using merchants’ data illegally.
The European Commission’s focus is on Amazon’s dual function, as a company hosting merchants on its site and as a rival to these same retailers via its own products, made or improved based on the retailers’ data.
In a questionnaire sent to retailers, the Commission asked whether Amazon’s own brand products launched in the past five years were identical or very similar to rival products offered on its platform.
Merchants were asked how Amazon’s products have affected their business, their investment, marketing, pricing, sales strategy and business decisions, and whether the number of sellers increased or decreased following Amazon’s entry.
Regulators also wanted to know if Amazon had contacted retailers or their suppliers before launching new products.
Merchants were asked to provide documents such as exchanges with Amazon or their suppliers and screenshots of websites to prove their claims.
Retailers were given until Oct. 9 to reply to the 16-page questionnaire.
One of the companies surveyed by the Commission posted the questionnaire online.
Amazon declined to comment.
Vestager has said she wants to check whether all the data gathered by Amazon gives it an edge.
“Is that giving you as the big guy, and in some member states a very big guy, an advantage that cannot be matched because you have this special access to data?,” she told reporters in Washington on Thursday.
The issue has two competition angles, said an antitrust lawyer who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.
“Is there an abuse of dominance in the market and the way Amazon deals with sensitive data?” the lawyer said.
Vestager can levy fines of up to 10 percent of a company’s global turnover for breaching EU rules as well as force them to change their business practices.","['EU antitrust regulators are asking retailers and manufacturers whether Amazon’s (AMZN.O) sales of own brand products similar to theirs have harmed their business, a move which could lead to a formal case and possibly fines against the U.S. tech giant.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,T-MOBILE US REPORTS LARGEST CUSTOMER GROWTH IN 4 YEARS,"SAN FRANCISCO - T-Mobile US, the fourth-largest U.S. carrier, lost thousands of customers over the past few years to rivals that offered cooler phones.
But it appears to be getting its groove back.
The company Thursday said it had gained 1.1 million customers, including 685,000 contract subscribers, over its second quarter.
That compares with losing 557,000 contract subscribers, the most valuable type of customer, in the same period a year ago.
The uptick represents its largest customer growth in four years.
The company, based in Bellevue, Wash., only started offering the iPhone in April, when it also began offering new phone plans that address common frustrations with wireless companies, like confusing contracts and expensive data plans.
“By fixing the things that drive them mad, like contracts and upgrades, and freeing them from the two-year sentences imposed on them by our competitors, they are choosing the new T-Mobile in unprecedented numbers,” John Legere, the chief executive of T-Mobile US, said in a news release.
Over the past several years, T-Mobile lost many customers largely because it lacked the iPhone, and customers were unhappy with its service.
But this year has been jam-packed with change for the company: It finally landed a deal with Apple to sell the iPhone, it began an overhaul of its network and it started offering lower-cost plans to lure customers from competitors.
The company also has extra muscle from its merger with the smaller carrier MetroPCS, which was completed in May.
The change is costing T-Mobile.
The company posted a loss of $16 million for the quarter, compared with a profit of $207 million last year in the same period.
But it also reported revenue of $6.23 billion, up from $4.9 billion last year.
The net income was above the expectations of Wall Street analysts.
They had expected revenue of $6.01 billion, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.
In March, T-Mobile discontinued two-year contracts, instead allowing customers to buy a smartphone for a lower upfront cost and adding the cost of the device to their monthly bill.
It also continued to offer plans with unlimited data, an option that the top two carriers, Verizon Wireless and AT&T, killed years ago.
In general, T-Mobile’s plans are also cheaper than its competitors’ - for $70 a month, a customer can have unlimited minutes, text messages and data.
The plans offered by AT&T and Verizon cost upward of roughly $100 a month.
T-Mobile expects the growth to continue.
For the full year, it said it expected to add between 1 million and 1.2 million contract subscribers.","['SAN FRANCISCO - T-Mobile US, the fourth-largest U.S. carrier, lost thousands of customers over the past few years to rivals that offered cooler phones.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Greek climate expert calls for actions to deal with extreme weather two months after Mati fire,"Two months after Greece's seaside resort of Mati was engulfed by a devastating wildfire, which had claimed 99 lives, a distinguished Greek climate expert has warned of the risks of more extreme weather and called for actions to deal with them.
As Mati's local authorities are still trying to heal the wounds of fire, Christos Zerefos, Supervisor of the Research Center for Atmospheric Physics and Climatology of the Academy of Athens and member of various International Scientific Committees, warned in a recent interview with Xinhua that the climate change will make us more often face extreme weather events, either strong winds or heavy rainfall.
And he urged for actions by the end of this century to get Greece better ready for natural disasters.
""If we do not take action at national and international level by the end of the 21st century, the cost of natural disasters in our country will amount to 700 billion euros (823.8 billion U.S. dollars).
It is twice the debt of Greece,"" warned Zerefos.
As one of the experts Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras turned to in the aftermath of the tragedy, Zerefos described the scenes in Mati, only 29 km east of Capital Athens, as a battlefield after bombardment.
The signs of disaster are still visible, as hundreds of gutted houses are left in ruins and people are still accommodated at camps, according to Zerefos.
The Greek prime minister has requested their scientific knowledge and experience for dealing with natural disasters and avoiding such tragedies in the future.
One of the main causes of the fire, according to Zerefos, is that the firefighting forces did not manage to control it in the first five minutes, as strong winds were blowing in the area.
Another bad estimate was that the wind would change direction and that Marathon Avenue, where Marathon race was born 2,500 years ago, would serve as a natural obstacle to the blazes, something that did not happen.
""In the disaster, except from the pine trees, more than 200 cars were also burned in the area.
The burning of cars equals to about one and a half gasoline tank, explosions occurred and temperatures rose too much, having reached 1,300 degrees Celsius.
So it was like a war, as if the area had been bombarded,"" Zerefos explained.
For Zerefos, preventing such kind of disaster from happening again is also very important.
""If we strengthen the prevention and protection mechanisms, a process that has already begun, this cost will be reduced to around 400 billion euros (470.7 billion U.S. dollars).
It is important therefore to adapt as it is important to try to learn to live with the extreme phenomena,"" the Greek scientist concluded.
Some flood control projects have already entered into force in the afflicted areas of Attica and will cost 17 million euros (20 million U.S. dollars), according to a recent Greek Economy and Development ministry pres statement.
The aim is to shield the affected areas against natural disasters, and to protect and regenerate the ecosystems.
Last week the number of the victims from the deadly fire in Mati rose to 99, as one woman was succumbed to her injuries.
The 26-year-old lost her battle to life after a long stay in the Intensive Care Unit.
There are still 17 injured in hospitals.","[""Two months after Greece's seaside resort of Mati was engulfed by a devastating wildfire, which had claimed 99 lives, a distinguished Greek climate expert has warned of the risks of more extreme weather and called for actions to deal with them.""

Generate a news article for the following headline.,U.S. MMA fighter Jeff Monson elected to local council in Russia,"U.S. mixed martial arts fighter Jeffrey Monson, granted Russian citizenship by President Vladimir Putin in May, was elected on Sunday to the council of deputies of a small city just outside Moscow, official election results showed on Monday.
Monson, 47, a tattooed cage fighter known as The Snowman, registered in June to run for a seat on the council of Krasnogorsk, northwest of Moscow, where election documents say he now works as a coach in a sports club.
On the website of Moscow region’s election commission, Monson is listed as fourth on the ruling United Russia party’s list of candidates for the Krasnogorsk city council.
United Russia won 47.9 percent of this vote, automatically securing a seat for the MMA fighter, who was born in the U.S. state of Minnesota.
Writing on social media, Monson, who has previously cultivated ties to the Russian Communist Party, said he ran as an independent.
“I was invited by United Russia party to run but I am independent.
Unfortunately I learned there are no communists in Communist party in Russia,” Monson said on Monday.
Monson, a vocal critic of U.S. foreign policy, said in January 2016 he was applying for Russian citizenship because he had felt a solidarity with the Russian people since he first visited their country in 2011.
“I have big plans for work with children, am preparing various projects, including projects focused on promoting healthy lifestyles,” Monson was cited as saying on election day by the local division of the United Russia party.
“Everything I do in Krasnogorsk - it’s because I love Russia,” Monson was cited as saying.
Videos shared on Monson’s official Instagram page showed the sportsman in a Russia hockey team sweater, casting a ballot at a Krasnogorsk polling station with the help of a translator.","['U.S. mixed martial arts fighter Jeffrey Monson, granted Russian citizenship by President Vladimir Putin in May, was elected on Sunday to the council of deputies of a small city just outside Moscow, official election results showed on Monday.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"Huge blasts at Chinese port kill 50, injure more than 700","Two huge explosions tore through an industrial area where toxic chemicals and gas were stored in the northeast Chinese port city of Tianjin, killing at least 50 people, including at least a dozen fire fighters, officials and state media said on Thursday.
At least 700 people were injured, more than 71 seriously, the Tianjin government said on its Weibo microblog, and the official Xinhua news agency said two fires were still burning.
Wednesday night’s blasts, so large that they were seen by satellites in space, sent shockwaves through apartment blocks kilometers away in the port city of 15 million people.
Internet videos showed fireballs shooting into the sky and the U.S. Geological Survey registered the blasts as seismic events.
Vast areas of the port - the 10th largest in the world - were devastated, crumpled shipping containers were thrown around like match sticks, hundreds of new cars were torched and port buildings left as burnt-out shells, Reuters witnesses said.
“I was sleeping when our windows and doors suddenly shook as we heard explosions outside.
I first thought it was an earthquake,” Guan Xiang, who lives 7 km (4 miles) away from the explosion site, told Reuters by telephone.
Guan, 24, said he saw flames and a mushroom cloud in the sky as he and other residents scrambled to get out of the building.
Tianjin authorities said 12 firefighters were among the 44 killed.
The cause of the blasts was being investigated but Xinhua said several containers caught fire beforehand.
Industrial accidents are not uncommon in China following three decades of breakneck economic growth.
A blast at an auto parts factory in eastern China killed 75 people a year ago when a room filled with metal dust exploded.
The state-run Beijing News earlier cited Tianjin fire authorities as saying they had lost contact with 36 firefighters.
By late afternoon, Xinhua reported 18 were missing, while 66 were among the hundreds of people being treated in nearby hospitals.
Xinhua said 1,000 firefighters and more than 140 fire engines were struggling to contain a blaze in a warehouse that held “dangerous goods”.
“The volatility of the goods means the fire is especially unpredictable and dangerous to approach,” Xinhua said.
Several fire trucks had been destroyed and nearby firefighters wept as they worked to extinguish flames, the Beijing News reported.
President Xi Jinping demanded that authorities “make full effort to rescue and treat the injured and ensure the safety of people and their property”.
Xi said in a statement carried by official media that those responsible should be “severely handled”.
City officials had met recently with companies to discuss tightening safety standards on the handling of dangerous chemicals.
The Tianjin Administration of Work Safety posted a notice about the meeting with companies at the port on its website a week ago.
POTENTIALLY TOXIC SMOKE
Anxious residents rushed to hospitals to seek news about injured loved ones.
Dozens of police guarded the entrance of the TEDA hospital, a Reuters witness said.
Pictures on Chinese media websites showed residents and workers, some bleeding, fleeing their homes.
Xinhua said people had been hurt by broken glass and other flying debris.
Authorities told reporters they expected the blasts to have forced 6,000 people from their homes by nightfall.
Grey clouds of smoke billowed above the blast site and several trucks carrying paramilitary police - wearing masks to protect them from potentially toxic smoke - headed to the area.
The blasts shattered windows in buildings and cars and knocked down walls in a 2-km radius around the site.
Photographs on news websites showed burned-out cars inside a multi-storey car park at a logistics base at the port.
Video posted on YouTube from what appeared to be an apartment building some distance from the scene showed an initial blast followed by a second, much bigger, explosion.
Shockwaves hit the building seconds later.
""Our building is shaking.
Is this an atomic bomb?""
said a frenzied voice inside.
Despite the devastation, the port was operating normally, a port official said.
Tianjin port is the gateway to northern China’s industrial belt.
Xinhua said the explosions, the first equivalent to 3 tonnes of TNT and the second to 21 tonnes of TNT, ripped through a warehouse.
A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Beijing environmental emergency response center, as well as 214 Chinese military nuclear and biochemical materials specialists, had gone to Tianjin, the news agency said.
It identified the owner of the warehouse as Tianjin Dongjiang Port Ruihai International Logistics.
The company’s website said it was a government-approved firm specializing in handling “dangerous goods”.
Company officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
According to an assessment by government environmental inspectors published in 2014, the facility was designed to store several dangerous and toxic chemicals including butanone, an explosive industrial solvent, sodium cyanide and compressed natural gas.
CCTV said at least one person at a “relevant company” had been detained.
Among the injured were some employees of John Deere & Co (DE.N), the U.S. farm and construction equipment maker based in Moline, Illinois.
Company spokesman Ken Golden said several employees who were at home at the time of the blasts sustained serious injuries and that some are in critical condition.
In addition, a small group of Deere employees working at the company’s facilities sustained minor injuries from blown-out windows, Golden said in a written statement.","['Two huge explosions tore through an industrial area where toxic chemicals and gas were stored in the northeast Chinese port city of Tianjin, killing at least 50 people, including at least a dozen fire fighters, officials and state media said on Thursday.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,UNESCO plans 8th Pacific Tsunami drill for September-November,"Over 40 countries in the Pacific Rim will participate in a mock tsunami scenario for September-November period this year to test their ""tsunami decision-making procedures and communication systems and processes,"", UNESCO (UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) said Thursday.
Called Exercise Pacific Wave 2018 (PacWave18), the 8th Pacific Tsunami drill ""will simulate Pacific countries in a Tsunami Warning situation requiring government decision-making and community action, essentially all aspects of the Disaster Risk Reduction cycle,"" said UNESCO, a sponsor of scientific studies and exercises on warning systems for various types of natural disasters.
Thanks to the PacWave18, concerned countries would have the opportunity to test new tools including tsunami wave forecasts that will allow each country to better assess its own tsunami threat, according to the Paris-based UN body.
As part of the exercise, participating countries would select from seven different Pacific scenarios based on real events from the past and conduct at least a Tabletop Exercise within the period of September to November, it noted.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii, NWPTAC in Japan, and the SCSTAC in China would send simulated warnings, which would trigger a country's tsunami response that would be evaluated by experts, it added.
""The events of the 2009 Samoa Islands Region, 2010 Chile, 2011 Japan, and the February 2013 Solomon Islands tsunamis have increased our need to be more prepared for such events,"" said Vladimir Ryabinin, Executive Secretary of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.
""This important exercise will validate the enhanced products for future official use by countries of the Pacific Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System,"" he added.
About 76 percent of the world's deadly tsunami occurrences take place in the Pacific Ocean and connected seas.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,India decision to decline foreign aid for flood relief draws criticism,"India will not accept relief assistance from foreign governments for the flood-ravaged state of Kerala, the government has said, following offers of aid from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
The decision to decline foreign help drew criticism from the opposition which called for an end the suffering of the people of the southern state hit by the worst flooding in a century, which has killed hundreds of people.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has announced assistance of 6 billion rupees ($85 million), compared with a request from the state for at least 20 billion rupees.
Modi has promised more aid and his government said late on Wednesday that would come through “domestic efforts”.
“The government of India deeply appreciates offers from several countries, including from foreign governments, to assist in relief and rehabilitation efforts after the tragic floods in Kerala,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.
“In line with the existing policy, the government is committed to meeting the requirements for relief and rehabilitation through domestic efforts.”
This week, the United Arab Emirates offered assistance of $100 million while Qatar offered $5 million.
Many people from Kerala live and work in the Gulf.
Torrential rain that began in Kerala on Aug. 8 killed 231 people, destroyed tens of thousands of homes, and washed away roads and bridges, leading to an estimated loss of at least 200 billion rupees ($2.85 billion).
The rain eased over the weekend as the focus of efforts turned to relief and rehabilitation from rescue.
The main opposition Congress party accused Modi of exacerbating the crisis by failing to come through with more aid and creating obstacles to foreign help.
“This decision is quite disappointing to the people of Kerala,” Congress leader and former Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy wrote in a public letter to Modi.
“Rules should be such (that they) eradicate the sufferings of the people.
If there exist any obstacle against the acceptance of foreign aid, kindly look into the matter seriously and bring suitable modifications.”
The foreign ministry said the government would welcome contributions to the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund and the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund from foundations, Indians living abroad and from people of Indian origin.
Kerala’s Finance Minister Thomas Isaac said on Twitter the central government should compensate the state for refusing foreign aid.","['India will not accept relief assistance from foreign governments for the flood-ravaged state of Kerala, the government has said, following offers of aid from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.'

Daily inflation is now 4 percent, according to opposition legislator Angel Alvarado, with monthly inflation rising to 233 percent in September from 223 percent in August.
In an effort to stabilize prices, President Nicolas Maduro in August cut five zeros off the ailing bolivar currency, boosted the minimum wage by 3,000 percent, and pegged salaries to an elusive state-backed cryptocurrency.
Opposition legislators have become the only source for economic indicators after the central bank stopped publishing such information nearly three years ago as the economy began unraveling.
The International Monetary Fund estimates consumer prices would rise 1,000,000 percent in 2018.
Maduro was re-elected in May in a vote that dozens of foreign governments described as rigged.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Kenya faces worst flood crisis as country grapples with climate change,"Kenya is facing one of its worst floods crises in years after rainwater displaced thousands of people across the country.
The rains have been pounding the East African nation for the last two months.
Up to 32 of the 47 counties have been affected by floods but the worst are among those in arid regions, which normally receive little rainfall.
They include counties in the dry North namely Mandera, and Garissa and at the Coast like Tana River and Kilifi and in Eastern Machakos and Kitui.
Up to 300,000 people have been affected by floods, according to the Kenya Red Cross, and they are in dire need of food, water, clothing and shelter.
The humanitarian agency has also noted that over 70,000 animals have been washed away, hundreds of acres of crops destroyed and thousands of homes marooned by floods.
Tens of schools have further been destroyed by floods, affecting learning in several regions across the country.
A number of schools are hosting flood victims as hundreds of learners fail to report back for the second term which started last week Wednesday.
Other infrastructure destroyed include roads and bridges, with the government noting it would require up to 600 million U.S. dollars to repair the network.
Julius Korir, Infrastructure Principal Secretary, said 110 million dollars will be used on repair of rural roads while 400 million dollars will be used on fixing urban roads.
Kenya Red Cross puts the number of deaths at least 112 and the society has appealed for 5 million dollars in the short-term to support families affected by floods.
In the capital Nairobi, the worst affected are residents in the tens of slum districts across the city, who have been displaced mainly due to poor drainage.
However, the National Disaster Management Authority and Meteorological Department on Monday warned of floods in several city estates in the coming days due to expected heavy rains.
They include Langata, Syokimau, South B and South C, areas populated by the middle-class.
The Meteorological Department had predicted near-normal rainfall in most parts of the country between the March-May long rain seasons.
However, the rains have surpassed the intensity predicted by the weatherman, pointing to their unpredictability.
Analysts have blamed the current crisis to the effects of climate change, as the weather alternates from one extreme to another.
""Kenya is battling two extreme weather conditions in a span of four months.
Before the heavy rains, the country was gripped by dry weather that saw people and animals in arid areas starve to death.
Now the same people who were starving are dying of floods.
It is unexplainable,"" said Henry Wandera, an economics lecturer in Nairobi.
He attributed the predicament to the effects of climate change, whose vagaries are raging due to forest destruction, among other man-made causes.
""It is going to mid-May when the rains are supposed to have subsided in intensity but they are getting stronger to the worry of citizens,"" he said.
Besides floods and dry conditions, pests and diseases are other effects of climate change the country is grappling with.
Kenya is currently battling Fall armyworms that have ravaged acres upon acres of the maize crop for the second season threatening the staple.
But the worst it seems it is yet to come for the East African nation as more rains have been predicted.
""Heavy rainfall of more than 50mm in 24 hours is expected offshore and in all counties along the Coastal strip.
On Wednesday, moderate rainfall of more than 30mm in 24 hours is expected in the South Coast region,"" Peter Ambenje, acting Director of Kenya Meteorological Department, said in a statement Monday.","['Kenya is facing one of its worst floods crises in years after rainwater displaced thousands of people across the country.'

The rains have been pounding the East African nation for the last two months. Up to 32 of the 47 counties have been affected by floods but the worst are among those in arid regions, which normally receive little rainfall. They include counties in the dry North namely Mandera, and Garissa and at the Coast like Tana River and Kilifi and in Eastern Machakos and Kitui. Up to 300,000 people have been affected by floods, according to the Kenya Red Cross, and they are in dire need of food, water, clothing and shelter. The humanitarian agency has also noted that over 70,000 animals have been washed away, hundreds of acres of crops destroyed and thousands of homes marooned by floods. Tens of schools have further been destroyed by floods, affecting learning in several regions across the country. A number of schools are hosting flood victims as hundreds of learners fail to report back for the second term which started last week Wednesday. Other infrastructure destroyed include roads and bridges, with the government noting it would require up to 600 million U.S. dollars to repair the network. Julius Korir, Infrastructure Principal Secretary, said 110 million dollars will be used on repair of rural roads while 400 million dollars will be used on fixing urban roads. Kenya Red Cross puts the number of deaths at least 112 and the society has appealed for 5 million dollars in the short-term to support families affected by floods. In the capital Nairobi, the worst affected are residents in the tens of slum districts across the city, who have been displaced mainly due to poor drainage. However, the National Disaster Management Authority and Meteorological Department on Monday warned of floods in several city estates in the coming days due to expected heavy rains. They include Langata, Syokimau, South B and South C, areas populated by the middle-class. The Meteorological Department had predicted near-normal rainfall in most parts of the country between the March-May long rain seasons. However, the rains have surpassed the intensity predicted by the weatherman, pointing to their unpredictability. Analysts have blamed the current crisis to the effects of climate change, as the weather alternates from one extreme to another. ""Kenya is battling two extreme weather conditions in a span of four months. Before the heavy rains, the country was gripped by dry weather that saw people and animals in arid areas starve to death. Now the same people who were starving are dying of floods. It is unexplainable,"" said Henry Wandera, an economics lecturer in Nairobi. He attributed the predicament to the effects of climate change, whose vagaries are raging due to forest destruction, among other man-made causes. ""It is going to mid-May when the rains are supposed to have subsided in intensity but they are getting stronger to the worry of citizens,"" he said. Besides floods and dry conditions, pests and diseases are other effects of climate change the country is grappling with. Kenya is currently battling Fall armyworms that have ravaged acres upon acres of the maize crop for the second season threatening the staple. But the worst it seems it is yet to come for the East African nation as more rains have been predicted. ""Heavy rainfall of more than 50mm in 24 hours is expected offshore and in all counties along the Coastal strip. On Wednesday, moderate rainfall of more than 30mm in 24 hours is expected in the South Coast region,"" Peter Ambenje, acting Director of Kenya Meteorological Department, said in a statement Monday.","[2, 1, 0]","[8, 6, 7]"
Generate a news article for the following headline.,Boys' parents sought asylum,"The Tampa couple accused of kidnapping their sons at gunpoint and absconding on a sailboat across the Gulf of Mexico tried to formally seek asylum from Cuban authorities, asserting the lives of their children were at risk from U.S. government officials, one parent’s lawyer said Monday.
Joshua and Sharyn Hakken met with a lawyer in Cuba after arriving there in April, and were initially told they would be safe from U.S. law enforcement while their asylum application was reviewed, said Tampa lawyer Bryant Camareno, who is representing Sharyn Hakken.
""They sought counsel, and they actually met with a lawyer in Cuba,"" Camareno said.
""They felt that their kids’ lives were in danger from the (U.S.) government.""
He said the couple also believed that if Cuba rejected them, they would have time to seek protection at other foreign governments’ embassies in Havana.
The couple’s dreams of a safe haven abroad were short-lived.
Within days of the Hakkens’ arrival at Hemingway Marina outside Havana, Cuban authorities gave the U.S. permission to apprehend the family and extradite them to Florida.
Both parents are jailed as they await trial in Hillsborough Circuit Court on charges including kidnapping and child abuse.
But the description of the Hakkens’ overtures to Cuban officials and fears of government intrusion in their boys’ lives provides an early glimpse of their mind-set and legal strategy.
Camareno’s remarks to the Tampa Bay Times, made after Joshua and Sharyn Hakken briefly appeared in court Monday, marked the first time the couple’s own account of their motives has emerged.
The argument that the Hakkens were attempting to extricate their sons from a tyrannical child welfare system also promises to bring more national attention to the bizarre saga of an American family driven by mistrust of government to seek refuge in the Western Hemisphere’s last communist country.
On April 3, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office, Joshua Hakken, 35, kidnapped his children at gunpoint from the home of his mother-in-law, whom he bound with zip-ties.
He and Sharyn Hakken, 34, had lost custody of 4-year-old Cole and 2-year-old Chase after a series of incidents in Louisiana.
A court later terminated their parental rights.
Authorities said Joshua Hakken was arrested on drug charges in a hotel there last year, and was found with a gun talking about taking a ""journey to Armageddon’' in the presence of the boys when he was taken into custody.
The children were placed in foster care following the drug arrest, but Hakken showed up with a gun at their foster home demanding they be returned, according to authorities.
The foster parents called 911 and Hakken fled.
After the Hakkens’ extradition from Cuba, their sons were placed back in the custody of their grandmother, who lives north of Tampa.
Camareno said he and Jorge Chalela, Joshua Hakken’s attorney, are awaiting discovery materials from the Hillsborough State Attorney’s Office and are still in the early stages of reviewing the case.
But Camareno already expects to call witnesses from Cuba, and he said the case could involve international law and jurisdictional issues.
It is unclear what specific justification the Hakkens might have had for claiming special refugee status.
Cuba never signed the United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention, the backbone of international protection for asylum-seekers.
The treaty obligates governments to harbor those who fear persecution in their home countries for their political views, race or religion, among other factors.
""They weren’t too sure of what type of asylum they were seeking,"" Camareno said, ""but they were seeking asylum.""","['The Tampa couple accused of kidnapping their sons at gunpoint and absconding on a sailboat across the Gulf of Mexico tried to formally seek asylum from Cuban authorities, asserting the lives of their children were at risk from U.S. government officials, one parent’s lawyer said Monday.'

On April 3, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office, Joshua Hakken, 35, kidnapped his children at gunpoint from the home of his mother-in-law, whom he bound with zip-ties. He and Sharyn Hakken, 34, had lost custody of 4-year-old Cole and 2-year-old Chase after a series of incidents in Louisiana. A court later terminated their parental rights. Authorities said Joshua Hakken was arrested on drug charges in a hotel there last year, and was found with a gun talking about taking a ""journey to Armageddon’' in the presence of the boys when he was taken into custody. The children were placed in foster care following the drug arrest, but Hakken showed up with a gun at their foster home demanding they be returned, according to authorities. The foster parents called 911 and Hakken fled. After the Hakkens’ extradition from Cuba, their sons were placed back in the custody of their grandmother, who lives north of Tampa. Camareno said he and Jorge Chalela, Joshua Hakken’s attorney, are awaiting discovery materials from the Hillsborough State Attorney’s Office and are still in the early stages of reviewing the case. But Camareno already expects to call witnesses from Cuba, and he said the case could involve international law and jurisdictional issues. It is unclear what specific justification the Hakkens might have had for claiming special refugee status. Cuba never signed the United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention, the backbone of international protection for asylum-seekers. The treaty obligates governments to harbor those who fear persecution in their home countries for their political views, race or religion, among other factors. ""They weren’t too sure of what type of asylum they were seeking,"" Camareno said, ""but they were seeking asylum.""","The children were placed in foster care following the drug arrest, but Hakken showed up with a gun at their foster home demanding they be returned, according to authorities.

The foster parents called 911 and Hakken fled. Joshua and Sharyn Hakken met with a lawyer in Cuba after arriving there in April, and were initially told they would be safe from U.S. law enforcement while their asylum application was reviewed, said Tampa lawyer Bryant Camareno, who is representing Sharyn Hakken. He and Sharyn Hakken, 34, had lost custody of 4-year-old Cole and 2-year-old Chase after a series of incidents in Louisiana. Cuba never signed the United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention, the backbone of international protection for asylum-seekers. Within days of the Hakkens’ arrival at Hemingway Marina outside Havana, Cuban authorities gave the U.S. permission to apprehend the family and extradite them to Florida. Camareno’s remarks to the Tampa Bay Times, made after Joshua and Sharyn Hakken briefly appeared in court Monday, marked the first time the couple’s own account of their motives has emerged. ""They sought counsel, and they actually met with a lawyer in Cuba,"" Camareno said. The treaty obligates governments to harbor those who fear persecution in their home countries for their political views, race or religion, among other factors. He said the couple also believed that if Cuba rejected them, they would have time to seek protection at other foreign governments’ embassies in Havana. But Camareno already expects to call witnesses from Cuba, and he said the case could involve international law and jurisdictional issues. Both parents are jailed as they await trial in Hillsborough Circuit Court on charges including kidnapping and child abuse. But the description of the Hakkens’ overtures to Cuban officials and fears of government intrusion in their boys’ lives provides an early glimpse of their mind-set and legal strategy. The Tampa couple accused of kidnapping their sons at gunpoint and absconding on a sailboat across the Gulf of Mexico tried to formally seek asylum from Cuban authorities, asserting the lives of their children were at risk from U.S. government officials, one parent’s lawyer said Monday. ""They felt that their kids’ lives were in danger from the (U.S.) government."" It is unclear what specific justification the Hakkens might have had for claiming special refugee status.","[2, 0, 1]","[7, 8, 9]"
Generate a news article for the following headline.,Some children return to school in Indonesia quake city hoping to see friends,"Children in the Indonesian city of Palu began returning to school on Monday to tidy up their classrooms and hopefully see their friends 10 days after a major earthquake and tsunami struck.
The 7.5 magnitude quake on Sept. 28 brought down many buildings in the small city on Sulawesi island, 1,500 km (30 miles) northeast of Jakarta, while tsunami waves smashed into its beachfront.
But the biggest killer was probably soil liquefaction, which happens when a powerful quake turns the ground into a liquid mire and which obliterated several Palu neighborhoods.
The official death toll rose to 1,948 and bodies are still being recovered.
No one knows how many people are missing, especially in the areas hit by liquefaction, but it could be as high as 5,000, the national disaster agency said.
At one state high school, teenagers dressed in gray and white uniforms swept up broken glass in the classrooms.
Trophies had fallen from a broken school showcase and the basketball court was cracked.
“It’s sad to see our school like this,” said Dewi Rahmawati, 17, who expects to graduate next year and wants to study economics at university.
The students found out that they had to turn up to school through messages on Facebook and WhatsApp.
School principal Kasiludin said authorities told all teachers to show up for work from Monday to collect information on student numbers.
“We won’t force the students to come back because many are traumatized.
But we must start again soon to keep their spirits up and so they don’t fall behind,” he said.
The school had lost at least seven students and one teacher, he said.
Across the city, nine schools were destroyed, 22 teachers were killed and 14 were missing, the disaster agency said, adding that 140 tents had been set up for classes.
At the SMP Negeri 15 Palu middle school, fewer than 50 of its 697 students showed up.
School principal Abdul Rashid said he was aware of four students killed in the quake.
“Classes haven’t started.
We’re only collecting data to find out how many students are safe,” he said, adding that the education ministry would decide when schools open.
“I don’t think we’re ready.
Many children are traumatized and frightened.”
POSITIVE THINKING
One boy chatting in the school compound with friends said he was sad so few of his class mates had shown up.
“I want to think positively; I hope they are OK,” said Muhamad Islam Bintang Lima, dressed in the school uniform of white shirt and navy blue trousers.
Most of the dead from the quake and tsunami were in Palu, the region’s main urban center.
Figures for more remote areas are trickling in but they seem to have suffered fewer deaths than the city.
Sulawesi is one of Indonesia’s five main islands.
The archipelago sees frequent earthquakes and occasional tsunamis.
In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.
A spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency said on Sunday searches for bodies would stop on Thursday.
Debris would be cleared and areas hit by liquefaction would be turned into parks and sports venues and will include memorials.
About 70,000 people have been displaced and many are living in basic shelters in Palu and surrounding hills.
A plan to relocate communities is being drawn up, the agency said.
The government has allocated 560 billion rupiah ($37 million) to help victims of the earthquake.
An International Monetary Fund/World Bank meeting that the government is hosting on the island of Bali this week has drawn some criticism from the political opposition.
“What is the benefit for us Indonesian people, especially in this time of catastrophe,” Fadli Zon, deputy speaker of parliament from the opposition Gerindra party, said on Twitter, taking issue with government spending on the meeting.","['Children in the Indonesian city of Palu began returning to school on Monday to tidy up their classrooms and hopefully see their friends 10 days after a major earthquake and tsunami struck.'

Across the city, nine schools were destroyed, 22 teachers were killed and 14 were missing, the disaster agency said, adding that 140 tents had been set up for classes. School principal Kasiludin said authorities told all teachers to show up for work from Monday to collect information on student numbers. But we must start again soon to keep their spirits up and so they don’t fall behind,” he said. “It’s sad to see our school like this,” said Dewi Rahmawati, 17, who expects to graduate next year and wants to study economics at university. The school had lost at least seven students and one teacher, he said. The students found out that they had to turn up to school through messages on Facebook and WhatsApp. We’re only collecting data to find out how many students are safe,” he said, adding that the education ministry would decide when schools open. “Classes haven’t started. “I don’t think we’re ready. School principal Abdul Rashid said he was aware of four students killed in the quake. Many children are traumatized and frightened.” POSITIVE THINKING At the SMP Negeri 15 Palu middle school, fewer than 50 of its 697 students showed up.

Figures for more remote areas are trickling in but they seem to have suffered fewer deaths than the city.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"As the court-appointed guardian and self-described fixer of some of America's most wayward companies, Richard C. Breeden, the former top securities regulator, is considered a pillar of corporate ethics and governance.
Now he trying to become another paragon -- that of savvy investor in troubled companies.
And in the coming months he will face his first major test: taking on the Applebee's International restaurant chain in a proxy fight.
Mr. Breeden's fledgling advocacy hedge fund, Breeden Partners, which owns a 5.2 percent stake in Applebee's, began its battle last month, when Mr. Breeden nominated four close friends to its board.
Hedge funds, the lucrative private investment pools for institutions like endowments and pensions, and for the wealthy, are nearly always managed by former Wall Street traders or money managers.
Mr. Breeden -- a Harvard-trained securities lawyer -- has no investing experience.
But he is seeking to bring his knowledge of securities laws and corporate governance into investing in underperforming companies.
Some in the business are skeptical.
""I guess I wonder, how does a guy with no investment management experience run a hedge fund?""
asked Philip Goldstein of Bulldog Investors, which runs hedge funds similar in style and intent to that of Mr. Breeden.
""You get the guys leaving Goldman Sachs and raising $2 billion, but this is even more astonishing -- he doesn't have a track record.""
Mr. Goldstein added that ""it's kind of like starting at the top -- you'd think you'd want to work at a hedge fund for a while.""
But what Mr. Breeden may lack in investing experience, he makes up for in other ways, according to his friends, who cite his hard-driving nature, his intellect, his attention to detail and his decisiveness, if marred at times by a divalike attitude.
""If it's a bad idea, Richard will kick it down the toilet and flush,"" said Laurence E. Harris, a lawyer in Washington who is one of four close friends that Mr. Breeden nominated last month to the board of directors at Applebee's, with a view to gaining a say in how the company is run.
Mr. Breeden ""knows what to look for,"" Mr. Harris said.
""He's a lot less likely to be fooled than a lot of people who are pure investors, because he understands the mechanics of corporate governance and securities laws.""
Mr. Breeden, 57, declined to comment for this article.
He has not only has a new professional life, but a new personal one as well.
Last year, Mr. Breeden married a trust administrator of the Bennett Funding Group, which he had overseen as the court-appointed monitor.
(He and his first wife, Holly, were divorced in 2005 after 27 years of marriage.)
Mr. Breeden is now perhaps the most senior former government official ever to run a hedge fund.
Mr. Breeden oversaw the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1989 to 1993.
He then ran one of the world's largest accounting firms, Coopers & Lybrand, before establishing his private firm, Richard C. Breeden & Company, in Greenwich, Conn., to advise companies hobbled by ethics and governance problems.
In recent years, he has served as the high-profile outside monitor for scandal-plagued firms like WorldCom, which filed for bankruptcy in 2002 and Conrad Black's former company, Hollinger International.
It was when he was overseeing the bankruptcy of WorldCom, later MCI, that Mr. Breeden first began thinking about starting a hedge fund, according to friends and associates.
Seeing the roles played by the Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim Helú and Mark Neporent of the hedge fund Cerberus Capital as investors in MCI, he asked Mr. Harris, ""I'm thinking of starting a hedge fund -- what do you think?""
Mr. Harris, who recalled the conversation, said Mr. Breeden told him, ""The one thing I don't want to do is fail.""
Mr. Breeden's right-hand man at Breeden Partners is his friend Steven J. Quamme, a one-time mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer with whom Mr. Breeden once worked at Baker Botts, the Washington law firm.
When asked who was running the hedge fund -- in other words, picking companies in which to invest, Mr. Harris replied, ""I don't think you can actually separate Richard and Steve -- they're joined at the hip.""
Mr. Quamme did not return calls requesting comment.
An entrepreneur as well as an investor, Mr. Quamme has picked some winners in his past jobs, including a chain of video stores that was sold to Blockbuster Video early last decade and a chunk of the Einstein Brothers Bagels franchises.
Mr. Quamme, whom Mr. Breeden also nominated to serve on the Applebee's board, has also endured some setbacks.
His 50 percent stake in Boston Chicken, through Mayfair Partners, an investing partnership that he ran in the mid-1990s, went stale in 1998 when the restaurant and the partnership both filed for bankruptcy.
It is, of course, far too early to tell whether Mr. Breeden's knowledge and experience will make his hedge fund, whose philosophy is to invest in American companies with fixable problems in policy and governance, a winner.
Some analysts do not see his fund making an impact on Applebee's.
""We do not see a dramatic shift near-term in the company's strategic direction that would lead to the 'value creating' programs proposed by the activist,"" Andrew Barish, an analyst with Banc of America Securities wrote earlier this month.
Applebee's declined to comment on Mr. Breeden's proposals.
The fund sought to raise $1.25 billion but has so far brought in only around $500 million, including $400 million from Calpers, the California pension fund.
The hedge fund earned 7.73 percent in the third quarter of 2006, according to the most recent available data from Calpers.
To some, Mr. Breeden's leap into the hedge fund business on the heels of serving as a court-appointed monitor for so many large companies raises questions.
""It's an appearances problem, and it bothers me,"" said Michael Feiner, an ethics professor at Columbia Business School, adding that he thought government officials should be required to wait two years before working at hedge funds or lobbying groups.
""I'm disappointed that he is doing this.""
Mr. Breeden's spokesmen declined to answer questions on whether Breeden Partners would prohibit itself from investing in companies for which Mr. Breeden had served as a court-appointed monitor.
And the transparency that Mr. Breeden championed at the troubled companies he has overseen may go by the wayside with his new venture.
Like many hedge funds, Breeden Partners has affiliated entities registered in the Cayman Islands, to take advantage of generous offshore tax benefits.
Correction: January 23, 2007, Tuesday An article on the Street Scene page of Business Day on Friday about Richard C. Breeden, the former top securities regulator who is started a hedge fund aimed at troubled companies, misstated his former position at the accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand.

Mr. Breeden oversaw the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1989 to 1993. asked Philip Goldstein of Bulldog Investors, which runs hedge funds similar in style and intent to that of Mr. Breeden. An entrepreneur as well as an investor, Mr. Quamme has picked some winners in his past jobs, including a chain of video stores that was sold to Blockbuster Video early last decade and a chunk of the Einstein Brothers Bagels franchises. The hedge fund earned 7.73 percent in the third quarter of 2006, according to the most recent available data from Calpers. But what Mr. Breeden may lack in investing experience, he makes up for in other ways, according to his friends, who cite his hard-driving nature, his intellect, his attention to detail and his decisiveness, if marred at times by a divalike attitude. Mr. Breeden's fledgling advocacy hedge fund, Breeden Partners, which owns a 5.2 percent stake in Applebee's, began its battle last month, when Mr. Breeden nominated four close friends to its board. ""We do not see a dramatic shift near-term in the company's strategic direction that would lead to the 'value creating' programs proposed by the activist,"" Andrew Barish, an analyst with Banc of America Securities wrote earlier this month. Hedge funds, the lucrative private investment pools for institutions like endowments and pensions, and for the wealthy, are nearly always managed by former Wall Street traders or money managers. Mr. Breeden's spokesmen declined to answer questions on whether Breeden Partners would prohibit itself from investing in companies for which Mr. Breeden had served as a court-appointed monitor. Mr. Harris, who recalled the conversation, said Mr. Breeden told him, ""The one thing I don't want to do is fail."" Mr. Goldstein added that ""it's kind of like starting at the top -- you'd think you'd want to work at a hedge fund for a while."" It is, of course, far too early to tell whether Mr. Breeden's knowledge and experience will make his hedge fund, whose philosophy is to invest in American companies with fixable problems in policy and governance, a winner. When asked who was running the hedge fund -- in other words, picking companies in which to invest, Mr. Harris replied, ""I don't think you can actually separate Richard and Steve -- they're joined at the hip."" He was a co-chairman of the firm's international business; he did not run the firm. Last year, Mr. Breeden married a trust administrator of the Bennett Funding Group, which he had overseen as the court-appointed monitor. Mr. Quamme, whom Mr. Breeden also nominated to serve on the Applebee's board, has also endured some setbacks. Correction: January 23, 2007, Tuesday An article on the Street Scene page of Business Day on Friday about Richard C. Breeden, the former top securities regulator who is started a hedge fund aimed at troubled companies, misstated his former position at the accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand. His 50 percent stake in Boston Chicken, through Mayfair Partners, an investing partnership that he ran in the mid-1990s, went stale in 1998 when the restaurant and the partnership both filed for bankruptcy. Applebee's declined to comment on Mr. Breeden's proposals. Seeing the roles played by the Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim Helú and Mark Neporent of the hedge fund Cerberus Capital as investors in MCI, he asked Mr. Harris, ""I'm thinking of starting a hedge fund -- what do you think?"" Mr. Breeden is now perhaps the most senior former government official ever to run a hedge fund. He then ran one of the world's largest accounting firms, Coopers & Lybrand, before establishing his private firm, Richard C. Breeden & Company, in Greenwich, Conn., to advise companies hobbled by ethics and governance problems. To some, Mr. Breeden's leap into the hedge fund business on the heels of serving as a court-appointed monitor for so many large companies raises questions. And the transparency that Mr. Breeden championed at the troubled companies he has overseen may go by the wayside with his new venture. As the court-appointed guardian and self-described fixer of some of America's most wayward companies, Richard C. Breeden, the former top securities regulator, is considered a pillar of corporate ethics and governance. (He and his first wife, Holly, were divorced in 2005 after 27 years of marriage.) Mr. Breeden, 57, declined to comment for this article. ""I'm disappointed that he is doing this."" ""If it's a bad idea, Richard will kick it down the toilet and flush,"" said Laurence E. Harris, a lawyer in Washington who is one of four close friends that Mr. Breeden nominated last month to the board of directors at Applebee's, with a view to gaining a say in how the company is run. The fund sought to raise $1.25 billion but has so far brought in only around $500 million, including $400 million from Calpers, the California pension fund. Like many hedge funds, Breeden Partners has affiliated entities registered in the Cayman Islands, to take advantage of generous offshore tax benefits. And in the coming months he will face his first major test: taking on the Applebee's International restaurant chain in a proxy fight. Mr. Breeden's right-hand man at Breeden Partners is his friend Steven J. Quamme, a one-time mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer with whom Mr. Breeden once worked at Baker Botts, the Washington law firm. Mr. Breeden -- a Harvard-trained securities lawyer -- has no investing experience. Some analysts do not see his fund making an impact on Applebee's. But he is seeking to bring his knowledge of securities laws and corporate governance into investing in underperforming companies. ""I guess I wonder, how does a guy with no investment management experience run a hedge fund?"" Mr. Breeden ""knows what to look for,"" Mr. Harris said. ""He's a lot less likely to be fooled than a lot of people who are pure investors, because he understands the mechanics of corporate governance and securities laws."" He has not only has a new professional life, but a new personal one as well. Now he trying to become another paragon -- that of savvy investor in troubled companies. Some in the business are skeptical. ""It's an appearances problem, and it bothers me,"" said Michael Feiner, an ethics professor at Columbia Business School, adding that he thought government officials should be required to wait two years before working at hedge funds or lobbying groups.","Some in the business are skeptical.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,ADB approves loan for disaster recovery in Indonesia,"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Tuesday that it has approved a 500-million-U.S. dollar emergency assistance loan to support Indonesia's recovery and rehabilitation of Lombok and Central Sulawesi after recent disasters.
The Manila-based bank said the loan will provide immediate funding for the government's recovery and rehabilitation action plans, targeting urgent needs such as temporary shelters, social protection and services, as well as economic recovery through cash assistance, credit schemes and skills improvement programs.
""ADB's emergency assistance loan provides timely and flexible financing to help mitigate the devastating impacts of the recent disasters,"" said Sona Shrestha, ADB's Director for Public Management, Financial Sector, and Trade Division for Southeast Asia.
""The quick-disbursing loan modality will help ensure that post-disaster recovery and rehabilitation expenditures are met without compromising critical economic and social development expenditures in the national budget,"" she added.
The Emergency Assistance for Recovery and Rehabilitation from Recent Disasters is part of ADB's response to two recent disasters that hit Indonesia including a magnitude-7.0 earthquake that struck Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara province, in August, and a magnitude-7.4 earthquake that struck Central Sulawesi province in September.
These disasters claimed the lives of more than 2,600 people, injured some 18,000 people and displaced more than half a million, according to the ADB.
The ADB said housing and public infrastructure have suffered extensive damage, adding that the impact of the Central Sulawesi disaster has been particularly severe as the earthquake caused landslides, tsunami, and liquefaction, a condition where the ground itself loses stability and takes on liquid properties.
According to the ADB, the initial assessments suggest over 2.2 billion U.S. dollars in damage and losses in the affected provinces.
In October, the bank approved an emergency grant of 3 million U.S. dollars from the Asia Pacific Disaster Respond Fund for immediate relief in Central Sulawesi.
In addition, it is also supporting the Indonesian government with technical assistance in post-disaster needs assessments and reconstruction planning.
The ADB said it is preparing new technical assistance to build capacity for robust monitoring, evaluation, and financial reporting of the rehabilitation and reconstruction plans.","[""The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Tuesday that it has approved a 500-million-U.S. dollar emergency assistance loan to support Indonesia's recovery and rehabilitation of Lombok and Central Sulawesi after recent disasters.""

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"Mobile homes worth hundreds of millions of dollars are deteriorating in a muddy field in Arkansas and may never be used to house victims of Hurricane Katrina because of a dispute over where to install them, federal officials acknowledged Monday.
Only about 2,700 of the 25,000 mobile homes ordered at a cost of $850 million have been installed, and at least 10,000 are sitting in Hope, Ark., according to documents and statements from Federal Emergency Management Agency officials.
Though about 55,000 Louisiana families are still waiting for a manufactured housing unit, the mobile homes may never be used because FEMA regulations prohibit them from being installed in flood-prone coastal areas, federal officials said.
Members of a Senate committee investigating the response to Hurricane Katrina called the mobile home episode an appalling example of government stumbling.
""These trailers are going to take the place of those very expensive toilet seats that we remember from Pentagon days,"" said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut.
""It's really absolutely unbelievable, and unacceptable.""
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, FEMA ordered far too many mobile homes and too few travel trailers, which are smaller, less expensive and more portable, and can be placed on lots in the disaster zone.
The federal government had expected that Louisiana officials would identify sites inland where the mobile homes could be placed.
But so far, with just a few exceptions, they has not done so, officials said.
""If sites for those mobile homes are not approved in Louisiana, it is possible they will never be used for hurricane relief,"" said Nicol Andrews, a FEMA spokesman.
The report on the mobile homes, as well as widespread fraud in FEMA's emergency assistance to hurricane victims, came as the federal government's top three domestic security and disaster relief officials vowed to fix flaws in the nation's emergency response programs.
""I am accountable and accept responsibility for the performance of the entire department, good and bad,"" the homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, told local and state disaster officials at a conference in Alexandria, Va. ""I also have the responsibility to fix what went wrong.""
The changes will include a cadre of new disaster response workers who will be available to respond quickly to any natural disaster or terrorist attack, Mr. Chertoff said, which could number as many as 1,500, a department official said.
The Homeland Security Department is also setting up specialized reconnaissance teams -- with access to helicopters, airplanes and high-tech electronic equipment that can send live video feeds to Washington -- to make sure officials know what is going on in a disaster zone.
Mr. Chertoff and R. David Paulison, the acting FEMA director, and Frances Fragos Townsend, President Bush's domestic security adviser, also promised to revise rules on debris removal and temporary housing, so local and state governments could move faster to clean up after a disaster and house the homeless.
Mr. Chertoff, Mr. Paulison and Ms. Townsend, repeating plans Mr. Chertoff outlined last year, also said they would improve communications systems and the registration process for disaster victims, so there would be fewer delays in getting help for those most in need.
""Hurricane Katrina is a defining moment in the history of emergency management,"" Mr. Paulison said at the conference, organized by the National Emergency Management Association.
Ms. Townsend, who at the request of Mr. Bush has been conducting her own investigation into the government's response to Hurricane Katrina, said she would issue a report by the end of the month that would have more than 100 recommendations for improving disaster response.
""We must restore and re-earn your confidence and trust,"" she told the local and state officials, ""so that when somebody says 'I am from the federal government and I am here to help,' you can believe it and not laugh.""
Back in Washington, members of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee were learning of problems still unfolding.
To date, about 72,000 travel trailers have been installed and occupied, of the roughly 100,000 that have been bought.
Mr. Paulison said the agency was moving to order 10,000 more of the units, which cost about $10,000 each, while mobile homes cost on average $34,000.
FEMA officials said that they had installed both trailers and mobile homes after previous disasters and that they had no reason to believe that Hurricane Katrina would be different.
But Bill Croft, coordinator for the hurricane housing task force in Louisiana, said federal officials should have realized that many hard-hit communities are in a flood plain, where a federal regulation bans mobile homes.
""They are the ones who make these rules,"" Mr. Croft said.
He suggested that FEMA relax the regulation to allow the mobile homes near the coast.
Another alternative would involve having the federal government pay Louisiana for the full cost of providing services if large, so-called FEMAvilles with hundreds of mobile homes were created in rural or suburban areas.
Ms. Andrews, the FEMA spokeswoman, said that relaxing the flood-plain regulation was not the answer.
""There are areas throughout Louisiana and the southeastern United States that aren't in a flood plain,"" she said.
As it stands, Richard L. Skinner, inspector general at the Homeland Security Department, told the Senate panel, many of the mobile homes might have to be sold as surplus, stored for some future disaster use or given to another federal agency.
""If they're sold as surplus property, what kind of return can you expect on that?""
Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, asked Mr. Skinner.
His answer infuriated the panelmembers.
""It's certainly not going to be very high,"" he responded, given the way they were being stored at a spot where some are sinking into the mud.
""Some of the trailers that we inspected are actually warping, have lost wheels, and some have been cannibalized, parts taken out, and we don't even know where the parts are right now.
So their value is going to decrease tremendously.""","['Mobile homes worth hundreds of millions of dollars are deteriorating in a muddy field in Arkansas and may never be used to house victims of Hurricane Katrina because of a dispute over where to install them, federal officials acknowledged Monday.'

Back in Washington, members of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee were learning of problems still unfolding. ""If they're sold as surplus property, what kind of return can you expect on that?"" He suggested that FEMA relax the regulation to allow the mobile homes near the coast. FEMA officials said that they had installed both trailers and mobile homes after previous disasters and that they had no reason to believe that Hurricane Katrina would be different. Another alternative would involve having the federal government pay Louisiana for the full cost of providing services if large, so-called FEMAvilles with hundreds of mobile homes were created in rural or suburban areas. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, asked Mr. Skinner. The report on the mobile homes, as well as widespread fraud in FEMA's emergency assistance to hurricane victims, came as the federal government's top three domestic security and disaster relief officials vowed to fix flaws in the nation's emergency response programs. ""I am accountable and accept responsibility for the performance of the entire department, good and bad,"" the homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, told local and state disaster officials at a conference in Alexandria, Va. ""I also have the responsibility to fix what went wrong."" ""There are areas throughout Louisiana and the southeastern United States that aren't in a flood plain,"" she said. But so far, with just a few exceptions, they has not done so, officials said. To date, about 72,000 travel trailers have been installed and occupied, of the roughly 100,000 that have been bought. ""Hurricane Katrina is a defining moment in the history of emergency management,"" Mr. Paulison said at the conference, organized by the National Emergency Management Association. So their value is going to decrease tremendously."" In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, FEMA ordered far too many mobile homes and too few travel trailers, which are smaller, less expensive and more portable, and can be placed on lots in the disaster zone. ""They are the ones who make these rules,"" Mr. Croft said. Mobile homes worth hundreds of millions of dollars are deteriorating in a muddy field in Arkansas and may never be used to house victims of Hurricane Katrina because of a dispute over where to install them, federal officials acknowledged Monday. ""Some of the trailers that we inspected are actually warping, have lost wheels, and some have been cannibalized, parts taken out, and we don't even know where the parts are right now. The Homeland Security Department is also setting up specialized reconnaissance teams -- with access to helicopters, airplanes and high-tech electronic equipment that can send live video feeds to Washington -- to make sure officials know what is going on in a disaster zone. ""We must restore and re-earn your confidence and trust,"" she told the local and state officials, ""so that when somebody says 'I am from the federal government and I am here to help,' you can believe it and not laugh."" Though about 55,000 Louisiana families are still waiting for a manufactured housing unit, the mobile homes may never be used because FEMA regulations prohibit them from being installed in flood-prone coastal areas, federal officials said. ""It's certainly not going to be very high,"" he responded, given the way they were being stored at a spot where some are sinking into the mud. As it stands, Richard L. Skinner, inspector general at the Homeland Security Department, told the Senate panel, many of the mobile homes might have to be sold as surplus, stored for some future disaster use or given to another federal agency. Mr. Paulison said the agency was moving to order 10,000 more of the units, which cost about $10,000 each, while mobile homes cost on average $34,000. Members of a Senate committee investigating the response to Hurricane Katrina called the mobile home episode an appalling example of government stumbling. But Bill Croft, coordinator for the hurricane housing task force in Louisiana, said federal officials should have realized that many hard-hit communities are in a flood plain, where a federal regulation bans mobile homes. ""These trailers are going to take the place of those very expensive toilet seats that we remember from Pentagon days,"" said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. Mr. Chertoff and R. David Paulison, the acting FEMA director, and Frances Fragos Townsend, President Bush's domestic security adviser, also promised to revise rules on debris removal and temporary housing, so local and state governments could move faster to clean up after a disaster and house the homeless. Mr. Chertoff, Mr. Paulison and Ms. Townsend, repeating plans Mr. Chertoff outlined last year, also said they would improve communications systems and the registration process for disaster victims, so there would be fewer delays in getting help for those most in need. Ms. Townsend, who at the request of Mr. Bush has been conducting her own investigation into the government's response to Hurricane Katrina, said she would issue a report by the end of the month that would have more than 100 recommendations for improving disaster response. Only about 2,700 of the 25,000 mobile homes ordered at a cost of $850 million have been installed, and at least 10,000 are sitting in Hope, Ark., according to documents and statements from Federal Emergency Management Agency officials.

""We launched these smart electric cars on December 14 and had several stakeholders who came to witness this milestone,"" Andrew Kazilimani, the firm's director of operations said.
He said the first phase of the project involves importing the cars directly from China while plans were underway to establish a manufacturing factory in one of the multifacility economic zones in the country.
The initiative, he said, will make Zambia a hub in the supply of electric cars in the southern African region.
According to him, there were many benefits of using electric cars such as no expenses on fuel and no periodic maintenance required.
Ackim Nyirongo, the firm's director of sales and marketing, said about 10 electric cars have so far been ordered for stocking and will be arriving in the country next month.","['A Zambian firm has started importing smart electric vehicles from China, an official said on Sunday.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Texans prepare for impacts from Hurricane Harvey,"People in the southern part of Texas are preparing for significant impacts from Hurricane Harvey as it is expected to make landfall as a Category 3 Hurricane from the Gulf of Mexico on Friday.
According to the National Weather Service forecast, impacts on the City of Houston in the U.S. state of Texas are expected to mostly be significant rainfall.
The forecast currently indicates that Houston will see close to 50 cm of rainfall over the weekend and into early next week.
This is likely to cause dangerous flash flooding, and could cause area flooding throughout the entire Houston region.
Houston emergency services urge residents to take measures for both the impact of flooding and Tropical Storm force winds, including enough supplies for 5-7 days of water, food, medications and emergency items.
Furthermore, the emergency services advice residents should plan to park their vehicles out of streets beginning Friday, especially those prone to flooding.
Meanwhile, the Houston Fire Department is preparing evacuation boats and swift water rescue assets ahead of the arrival of the storm.
The Houston Police Department and Public Works and Engineering Department (PWE) is preparing high water rescue vehicles to be used in the event they become necessary.
In addition, PWE has identified 41 intersections that are prone to flooding, and will make barricades available as it becomes safe to do so.
The General Services Department, Department and Neighborhoods and PWE are preparing to conduct rapid damage assessment following the impacts from this storm.
The Office of Emergency Management (OEM) is coordinating the City' s disaster response with neighboring jurisdictions, the State of Texas and federal agencies as necessary.
In addition, OEM will activate the City' s Emergency Operations Center Friday evening in support of anticipated emergency actions.
The island of Galveston would be the frontline facing the hurricane.
Galveston issued on Thursday a voluntary evacuation for the West End of Galveston Island.
Especially, the residents who have medical needs or other conditions are urged to move elsewhere, since high tides and heavy rains could cut off access for those in need of help from emergency responders.
""The forecast is becoming more certain as the storm strengthens and the impacts to our area could be significant as we remain on the east side of the storm,"" Niki Bender, emergency management coordinator for the City of Galveston, told Xinhua.
""Residents should prepare their homes for tidal flooding from a potential 4- to 5-feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) storm surge, gusting tropical storm force winds, and possible rains in excess of 15 inches (38 cm) through the duration of this system passing through our area,"" Bender said.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"Duke shuts natgas plant due to Florence floods, coal ash leak feared","Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N) said it shut down a North Carolina natural gas plant due to flooding as the deluge of water continued in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which has killed more than 40 people.
Duke also said it cannot rule out the possibility that coal ash from another plant is flowing into nearby waters.
Water breached the cooling lake dam at Duke’s 625-megawatt natural gas L.V.
Sutton plant, causing the company to shut the plant.
Water is now exiting the cooling lake through breaches, one large and several smaller, the company said in a statement on Friday.
However, the company later in the day issued a statement saying the situation remains stable at the plant.
The company did not provide any further information on the status of the incident.
Hurricane Florence brought several feet of rain to parts of North Carolina over a period of days, and the historic level of storm flooding is not expected to subside until next week.
Duke reported two coal ash leaks from a retired plant in Wilmington, North Carolina, following storm Florence.
One came from its shuttered Sutton Power Plant on Saturday and a second on Sunday, according to federal officials.
Officials had worried the water would overwhelm several pits where coal ash had been stored, potentially contaminating rivers.
“We have not been able to get our feet on the ground to get the water quality sampling” due to flooding in the area, Michael Regan, Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, said during North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper’s Hurricane Florence briefing on Friday.
“We plan to conduct flyovers and partner with the Department of Transportation to see if we can ascertain ... whether any coal ash has filtered into the Cape Fear River,” Regan said.
Separately, company spokeswoman Paige Sheehan told Reuters they cannot rule out the possibility that coal ash might have entered the Cape Fear River.
Coal ash collects at the bottom of basins, making it difficult to determine when ash escapes from a site.
Coal ash can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife.
Ash pits and other embankments have ruptured under heavy rain in the past, and Duke Energy had agreed to secure the sites in North Carolina’s lowland areas - but that work is ongoing.
The company’s shares closed down almost 1 percent at $79.82 on Friday.","['Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N) said it shut down a North Carolina natural gas plant due to flooding as the deluge of water continued in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which has killed more than 40 people.'

In the summer of 1998, China's Yangtze River flooded, causing more than 1,000 deaths.
Determining rising water levels is one of the biggest challenges for the flood control office.
He still remembers that 20 years ago, when he was 16 years old, he had to patrol dikes every two hours, with a bamboo pole, a flashlight, and an umbrella, for days on end.
""I had to row a boat and even swim to the mid-stream to measure water levels.
It was troublesome and extremely dangerous,"" he said.
Thanks to the advancement of technology in flood control, officials like He no longer have to risk their lives to measure water levels.
""The automatic observation and flood prediction system achieves full coverage of the Yangtze -- the mainstream, primary tributaries, large reservoirs, key medium reservoirs and lakes along the river,"" He said.
In Anqing alone, more than 600 stations measure and report rainfall automatically, and 210 water level gauging stations provide precise and timely monitoring data, which helps officials form and implement emergency plans.
In addition, a series of flood control equipment has been put into use.
In 2016, a collapsible mobile ""water plugging wall"" with a waterproof canvas bag at its core was used to fill dike breaches in Anqing.
In just 10 minutes, the ""wall"" can swell up to six meters, serving as a water barrier.
""China has comprehensively strengthened its flood resistance ability in the past 20 years,"" He said.
In 2010, flood control headquarters in neighboring Jiangxi Province used satellite remote sensing to evaluate flood situations and dispatch rescue teams to the worst-hit areas.
Two years later, drones were used to monitor water levels.
This year, the province purchased five units of drainage equipment that can adapt to different environments such as cities and farmland.
Seven remote-control rescue robots also came into service in Jiangxi.
Shaped like lifeboats, these robots can evacuate three to four people stranded by the flood and deliver relief supplies.
""We have set up a compete flood prevention communication system, which can automatically send warning messages to residents once it detects a potential risk of flood,"" said Wang Bin, secretary general of Huaihe River Flood Control Headquarters.
""Technology improves prediction accuracy, increases rescue efficiency, and reduces losses caused by flooding.""

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"Exclusive: In test case, U.S. fails to force Facebook to wiretap Messenger calls","U.S. investigators failed in a recent courtroom effort to force Facebook to wiretap voice calls over its Messenger app in a closely watched test case, according to two people briefed on the sealed ruling.
Members of a joint federal and state task force probing the international criminal gang MS-13 had tried in August to hold Facebook in contempt of court for failing to carry out a wiretap order, Reuters reported last month.
Arguments were heard in a sealed proceeding in a U.S. District Court in Fresno, California weeks before 16 suspected gang members were indicted there, but the judge ruled in Facebook’s favor, the sources said.
The details of his reasoning were not available.
The government’s request had alarmed technology executives and privacy advocates.
Officials in the United States and other Western countries are stepping up attempts to ban or limit strong encryption and expand their wiretapping capabilities.
An affidavit by an FBI agent filed publicly in the Fresno criminal proceedings said that at the time of the arrests, law enforcement could not monitor any Messenger calls.
Telecommunications companies are required to give police access to calls under federal law, but many apps that rely solely on internet infrastructure are exempt.
Facebook contended Messenger was covered by that exemption.
The public court filings showed the government was intercepting all ordinary phone calls and Messenger texts between the accused gang members.
The FBI affidavit cited three Messenger calls that investigators were unable to hear.
The participants in those calls are now in jail pending trial.
Neither prosecutors nor Facebook would answer questions about the Fresno U.S. Attorney’s office attempt to hold Facebook in contempt or about the underlying wiretap request, including why the matter was dismissed.
The judge heard oral arguments on the contempt motion on Aug. 14.
Facebook and a Department of Justice spokeswoman declined to comment.
FBI agent Ryan Yetter, in the affidavit dated Aug. 30, wrote “currently, there is no practical method available by which law enforcement can monitor” calls on Messenger.
The affidavit was filed in support of a criminal complaint against members of MS-13, which is active in the United States and Central America.
MS-13 also known as Mara Salvatrucha is an international criminal gang that originated in Los Angeles in the 1980s.
The gang’s activities later spread to many parts of the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America.
U.S. President Donald Trump frequently uses the gang to symbolize what he faults as lax U.S. immigration policy.
Most of the 16 gang suspects were arrested by Aug. 30, and the indictment was issued on Sep. 13.
Including charges by California state, more than two dozen people were accused of murder and other crimes.
More information about the government’s court tussle with Facebook may come to light through lawyers for the 16 defendants.
Mark Broughton, an attorney for one of the defendants, Denis Barrera-Palma, said he would soon start receiving the government’s evidence.
If the prosecutors’ application to wiretap Facebook Messenger voice calls is not included, Broughton said he would ask for it.
“I would be interested in seeing, or trying to get an order unsealing that information to properly represent my client,” Broughton said.
Barrera-Palma faces federal counts of assault with a deadly weapon and drug conspiracy, and California charges of murder conspiracy.
He has pleaded not guilty to the federal counts and has not yet entered a plea in state court.
The still-private filings in the skirmish with Facebook might explain why federal officials picked Messenger’s voice calls as a target.
One matter judges weigh in wiretap matters is how much of a burden it would be for the company to help.
In contrast to Facebook’s WhatsApp messaging app and a separate part of Messenger called secret conversations, Facebook plays a small technical role facilitating Messenger voice calls, making interception possible with some effort.
Nevertheless, Facebook maintained it could not be ordered to alter its software or hack its user in order to help the FBI.
Apple made a similar argument in refusing to break into a terrorist’s iPhone in 2016.","['U.S. investigators failed in a recent courtroom effort to force Facebook to wiretap voice calls over its Messenger app in a closely watched test case, according to two people briefed on the sealed ruling.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China","Toyota Motor Corp, long opposed to producing its premium Lexus cars in China because of concerns over quality and profitability, is now considering it to ignite growth and narrow sales gaps with its German rivals, four company insiders told Reuters.
The company, which imports Lexus models made in Japan to sell in China, has spent the last two years researching how to produce them locally.
Toyota also talked to its Chinese joint-venture partners – Guangzhou Automobile Group Co and FAW Group - last year about Lexus models.
It wasn’t clear whether Toyota approached the Chinese companies about a partnership or vice versa.
Local production would be a major shift for the world’s largest automaker, encouraged by improved China-Japan ties, as well as new Chinese investment rules that might allow foreign automakers to fully own or majority-control China operations.
“We’re torn over this,” said one of the insiders.
“But it makes little sense to let this opportunity slip by,” another told Reuters.
All four insiders declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
China’s planned scrapping of foreign ownership restrictions in the auto industry is in part a response to criticism that Chinese companies have been largely allowed to invest freely in outside markets while Beijing limits foreign firms’ access to the world’s second-largest economy.
The rule changes - affecting electric carmakers this year and others by 2022 - led Tesla Inc to gain Beijing’s approval for a wholly-owned China manufacturing and sales company in Shanghai.
That marked the first time a foreign carmaker established itself in China without a partner.
Toyota already produces numerous Toyota-brand models, including the Camry, Highlander, Corolla, Levin and Crown, in China with partners.
Last year it sold 1.29 million cars there, including imported Lexuses.
Toyota had contemplated moving Lexus production to China before - as far back as 2011-12, according to one of the four insiders.
But it had until now considered a potential erosion of quality too much of a risk, and didn’t want to sacrifice the brand’s relatively high margins by sharing profits with a local partner.
Two of the Toyota insiders said the automaker had identified specific scenarios for localizing Lexus.
“All the preparation has been more or less completed,” one said.
“All we’re waiting is a ‘go’ from management.”
TRICKY TIMING
Toyota’s preferred option is to own all or most of a localized Lexus unit, which it could do immediately by building only electric cars.
(Lexus has plans for electric battery and plug-in electric hybrid versions of existing models.)
But China might not let another brand in when the market has slowed down significantly, with sales of some foreign vehicles, including Groupe PSA, Ford and Hyundai, all falling in the gutter in recent months.
“You’d still need a good political follow-wind to execute this,” one of the sources said, pointing to help from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has a state visit to China planned for this month.
Even as other premium brands - such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac - have opened assembly plants in China to gain market share, Toyota has resisted.
That reluctance reflects the company’s unwillingness to share with a Chinese partner a brand painstakingly built since 1989 into a top premium car in the United States.
Opponents inside Toyota also point to China’s lowering tariffs on passenger cars to 15 percent from 25 percent in July as a reason to keep importing Lexuses.
They also note that the nearest Lexus plant to China is at the northern tip of Japan’s southernmost main island of Kyushu -only two days from Shanghai by sea.
A Toyota spokesman in Tokyo said “the most important task” for Lexus is to become a distinguished brand in China.
“We always weigh the need for localizing production as part of the consideration for the Lexus brand’s future in China,” he said.
“But at this point in time, we don’t have any specific plans for producing Lexus cars in China.”
Nonetheless, support for localization is growing among Toyota leaders.
China has typically been a difficult market for Japanese companies, but there is new optimism, especially after an official visit to Japan by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in May.
During his visit, Li toured Toyota facilities on the northern island of Hokkaido, escorted by the company’s family scion and chief executive, Akio Toyoda.
Toyoda has since sought to boost his company’s presence in China, including an effort to significantly expand its manufacturing capacity and distribution networks, and share more technologies with Chinese companies.
NEED FOR SPEED
China has also proposed limiting new production capacity for automakers, adding an incentive for Toyota to move quickly if it wants to build Lexus models there.
Nissan Motor Co and Toyota have each recently revealed plans to boost capacity, much of which will be used to produce electric cars.
Alan Kang, a Shanghai-based analyst for consultancy LMC Automotive, thinks localizing production is exactly what Lexus needs to start narrowing the big sales gap with German premium brands.
Mercedes-Benz, for example, last year sold about 610,000 vehicles, compared to 130,000 for Lexus during the same year, according to LMC.
“If Lexus doesn’t want to remain a niche, it needs to start investing more,” Kang said.","['Toyota Motor Corp, long opposed to producing its premium Lexus cars in China because of concerns over quality and profitability, is now considering it to ignite growth and narrow sales gaps with its German rivals, four company insiders told Reuters.'

But it had until now considered a potential erosion of quality too much of a risk, and didn’t want to sacrifice the brand’s relatively high margins by sharing profits with a local partner.

They also note that the nearest Lexus plant to China is at the northern tip of Japan’s southernmost main island of Kyushu -only two days from Shanghai by sea. Opponents inside Toyota also point to China’s lowering tariffs on passenger cars to 15 percent from 25 percent in July as a reason to keep importing Lexuses. That reluctance reflects the company’s unwillingness to share with a Chinese partner a brand painstakingly built since 1989 into a top premium car in the United States.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"Death toll rises to 158, dozens missing in torrential rain in Japan","The death toll continued to rise while government stepped up search and rescue efforts after torrential rain pummeled western Japan, causing flooding and landslides.
According to Japan's public broadcaster NHK, 158 people have been confirmed dead in 12 prefectures and 56 people are still unaccounted for.
Hiroshima prefecture was hit hardest by the record rainfall and subsequent landslides, with death toll there reaching 59, while Okayama prefecture suffered 54 deaths.
The government and local municipalities have stepped up search and rescue efforts to find the 56 people that are still unaccounted for, and as most of the people missing are in Hiroshima, death toll could further rise in the prefecture.
Meanwhile, more than 10,000 people in 15 prefectures were still staying under evacuation shelters as of Tuesday noon, with blazing heat now compounding the problem.
According to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), an active seasonal rain front caused torrential rain in most eastern and western regions of Japan since last Thursday.
The agency has warned that Japan's Kinki region, which includes Kyoto, Hyogo and Osaka prefectures, could be particularly hard-hit by downpours, escalating the risk of floods, landslides, lightning and tornadoes.
Regarding the heavy casualty, Emi Masatani, an expert from Japan Bousaisikai, a non-profit disaster-prevention organization, told Xinhua that people in Japan normally attach great importance to prevention of natural disasters, but sometimes fail to pay enough attention to heavy rainfalls as they are predictable.
According to local reports, many people chose to stay at home even after the weather agency issued emergency warnings and evacuation orders following the heavy rain and thus lost the chance to escape when flooding or landslides occurred.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who canceled his trip to Europe and the Middle East to attend to the disaster, told a meeting of the government's crisis response unit that reserve funds would be made available before requests came in from local governments.
""We will assess the needs of victims and push for quick reconstruction,"" the prime minister said.
Abe is scheduled to visit Okayama prefecture on Wednesday to inspect the damage and assess the evacuees' needs.
Japan's top government spokesperson Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a press briefing that the government is likely to tap into reserve funds of about 2 billion yen (18 million U.S. dollars) to help deal with the disaster's aftereffects.
But Farm Minister Ken Saito said that damage caused to agriculture, including mountain forests, paddy fields and reservoirs, had already topped 7 billion yen (63 million U.S. dollars).
The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said that as of Tuesday morning, 347 homes have been partially or completely destroyed by the downpours or in landslides and 9,868 homes have been flooded.
The extent of the damage is likely to rise significantly, the agency said, as many municipalities have yet to report the full extent of the damage.
Abe also said that to address food and water shortages in some of the disaster areas, trucks carrying food and water stocks to retail stores, including convenience stores, will be considered emergency vehicles.
The Health Ministry said that as of Tuesday morning, nearly 300,000 homes spanning 12 prefectures in western Japan were still without water supply.
To safeguard their workers, some major businesses in the disaster-hit regions have halted production, including at Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp.","['The death toll continued to rise while government stepped up search and rescue efforts after torrential rain pummeled western Japan, causing flooding and landslides.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Few poor New York city residents could benefit from half-price Metrocard program,"The majority of the estimated 800,000 New York city (NYC) residents living below the poverty line who were originally promised half-price Metrocards may not be able to receive the benefit, according to the city's Comptroller office.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the launch of Fair Fare program on Friday, saying that more than a hundred thousand New Yorkers are about to have the doors of opportunity opened for them thanks to the program.
""Our subway system began in 1904 and there has never been a time where low-income New Yorkers received discounted service,"" said de Blasio.
Using the Fair Fares MetroCard, eligible New York City residents may buy either an unlimited 7-day or 30-day pass for 16 U.S. dollars or 60.5 dollars respectively.
During the first phase of the program, Fair Fares MetroCards will be available to about 25,000 New Yorkers who are existing clients of the NYC Department of Social Services.
These individuals will receive letters informing them of their eligibility.
By mid-2019, the city expects to offer an additional 170,000 New Yorkers with lower incomes the chance to participate in Fair Fares NYC.
Only New York City residents are eligible to participate in this program.
However, NYC Comptroller Scott Stringer said in a press release that as the city significantly scaled back initial eligibility to just a small subset of Cash Assistance and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients, two of the city's social service programs, a majority of poor people will continue to face a significant financial burden to purchase a MetroCard.
""Hundreds of thousands of families will still struggle to get to work or a job interview because they can't afford a full fare.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,"The new Democratic leaders of the Senate and the House warned President Bush on Friday against sending additional troops to Iraq, setting the stage for what could become a major confrontation over a new war strategy.
Mr. Bush is expected to call for more troops in a speech as soon as Wednesday, as part of a renewed effort to secure Baghdad.
But Nancy Pelosi, the new speaker of the House, and Harry Reid, the new Senate majority leader, dismissed that approach as a strategy ""that has already failed.""
""Adding more combat troops will only endanger more Americans and stretch our military to the breaking point for no strategic gain,"" Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Reid wrote in a letter to Mr. Bush.
""We are well past the point of more troops for Iraq,"" they added, urging Mr. Bush to begin a ""phased redeployment,"" or gradual withdrawal.
Not all Democrats agree with the position their leaders staked out in the letter on Friday, just days before Mr. Bush is expected to announce a broad strategy involving more troops, accelerated training of Iraqi forces and a large increase in economic and reconstruction aid to Iraq.
But the release of the letter suggests that a major political battle may be brewing.
Mr. Bush appeared to be trying to head off any confrontation when he invited 13 Democratic and Republican senators to the White House Friday for what administration officials called a ""consultation"" on Iraq.
At a later meeting, Mr. Bush met with the former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, who cautioned that Congress would want to take time to consider the strategy before Mr. Bush began implementing it.
""The president has had this opportunity now for some weeks, and I think Congress is entitled to an opportunity to independently look at the situation,"" Mr. Warner said.
Mr. Bush has begun to put parts of his plan in place, making official on Friday some changes that will insure new faces are associated with a new approach.
He announced the nomination of Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus as the new commander in Iraq, to succeed Gen. George W. Casey Jr., whom Mr. Bush said he intended to elevate to Army chief of staff.
Mr. Bush praised General Casey, who spent much of 2006 pressing for a gradual withdrawal of troops, as ""strong and effective""; he hailed General Petraeus, who has reportedly backed an increase, as ""a soldier of vision and determination.""
Mr. Bush is also remaking his diplomatic team, nominating John D. Negroponte, the director of national intelligence, to be deputy secretary of state.
Ryan C. Crocker is expected to be nominated ambassador to Iraq.
His nomination would for the first time place an Arabist with experience in sectarian conflicts, mostly in Lebanon, at the head of the embassy in Baghdad.
Administration and Congressional officials said they expected the military and diplomatic nominations to receive Senate approval, though senators might use the hearings to air dissent about any troop increase and draw attention to the perceived failings of Iraq strategy.
The bigger question is whether Congress will seek to stop the troop increase.
In theory, it could cut off financing, the only way it could actually interfere with the commander in chief's plans.
But Democrats have said they would not take such a step, largely out of fear of being accused of undercutting the troops.
That leaves them with only one option: holding a series of hearings, which start next week, immediately after the president's speech, that are intended to expose the divisions within the military over the wisdom of increasing troops.
Many senior officers, including General Casey, have argued that adding American troops will undercut the effort to get the Iraqi government to defend itself.
Some Republican leaders insisted that Congress should not go down that path.
""I don't think that we should be dictating military strategy in Iraq from Capitol Hill,"" said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican minority leader in the House.
In addition to the 13 senators, Democrats and Republicans, invited to the White House on Friday afternoon, those attending the meeting included Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the Joint Chiefs chairman, Gen. Peter Pace, and Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser.
Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois, who both are considering a presidential candidacy, arrived at the White House at nearly the same time.
After the meeting, Mrs. Clinton did not issue a statement, while Mr. Obama spoke to reporters about his conversation with Mr. Bush.
""I personally indicated that an escalation of troop levels in Iraq was a mistake and that we need a political accommodation, rather than a military approach to the sectarian violence there,"" he said.
""I think he recognizes that the status quo is unacceptable and has to change.""
Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat, said she would consider supporting an increase in troops for a short time if the president could articulate ""specific opportunities for success,"" particularly cities that troops would be dispatched to and how long they would stay.
Ms. Landrieu also said she would need to be convinced that there was a broader solution to limit American involvement in Iraq.
""The American people's patience is wearing thin with the vagueness,"" she said, speaking to reporters as she left the White House.
In interviews after the meeting, several senators said they could not tell whether Mr. Bush had made a decision whether to call for a troop increase.
The senators described the meeting as frank but not confrontational.
But even those who have supported the administration's Iraq policy said it was time for a change of course.
""I don't know that the American people will see the surge as a new direction,"" said Senator Ben Nelson, a Democrat from Nebraska.
""The American people want to see a change in direction, not just a change in slogans.""
Senator Blanche Lincoln, an Arkansas Democrat at the meeting, said an increase in troops would face considerable scrutiny in Congress from Democrats and Republicans.
""I asked the president, 'Where would that surge come from?'
"" Ms. Lincoln said.
""He said that was a very good question.""","['The new Democratic leaders of the Senate and the House warned President Bush on Friday against sending additional troops to Iraq, setting the stage for what could become a major confrontation over a new war strategy.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"Magnitude 6.3 quake strikes off Papua New Guinea, no tsunami threat","A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the northeast coast of an island of the Pacific Ocean nation of Papua New Guinea on Saturday, officials said, but the tremor posed no tsunami threat to the region.
There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the quake, which was centered in a much more remote region than a magnitude 7.5 tremor that rocked the country’s mountainous mainland highlands on Feb. 26, killing 100 people.
The epicenter of Saturday’s quake was located 180 kilometers (112 miles) southwest of Rabaul on New Britain island, some 900 km northeast of the capital Port Moresby, at a depth of 68 km (40 miles), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said.
The quake was revised down from an initial reading of magnitude 6.8 and a depth of 60 km.
“Based on all available data a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami is not expected,” the Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said in a bulletin.
Quakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire”, a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates.
Rabaul lies in the shadow of Mount Tavurvur, an active volcano that destroyed the town in 1994 during a severe eruption.
The latest quake comes as Papua New Guinea struggles to get aid to desperate survivors of the Feb. 26 quake, which flattened whole villages and spoiled water supplies on the country’s main island.
A month on, disaster and relief officials say the scale of the emergency is testing the finances and capacity of one of the world’s poorest countries.
The impoverished country is also missing its largest revenue earner, after the quake forced a shutdown of Exxon Mobil Corp’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which has annual sales of $3 billion at current LNG prices.
The firm is still assessing quake damage at its facilities.","['A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the northeast coast of an island of the Pacific Ocean nation of Papua New Guinea on Saturday, officials said, but the tremor posed no tsunami threat to the region.'

A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the northeast coast of an island of the Pacific Ocean nation of Papua New Guinea on Saturday, officials said, but the tremor posed no tsunami threat to the region. The quake was revised down from an initial reading of magnitude 6.8 and a depth of 60 km. The epicenter of Saturday’s quake was located 180 kilometers (112 miles) southwest of Rabaul on New Britain island, some 900 km northeast of the capital Port Moresby, at a depth of 68 km (40 miles), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said. “Based on all available data a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami is not expected,” the Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said in a bulletin. Quakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire”, a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates. The latest quake comes as Papua New Guinea struggles to get aid to desperate survivors of the Feb. 26 quake, which flattened whole villages and spoiled water supplies on the country’s main island. Rabaul lies in the shadow of Mount Tavurvur, an active volcano that destroyed the town in 1994 during a severe eruption. The impoverished country is also missing its largest revenue earner, after the quake forced a shutdown of Exxon Mobil Corp’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which has annual sales of $3 billion at current LNG prices. The firm is still assessing quake damage at its facilities. A month on, disaster and relief officials say the scale of the emergency is testing the finances and capacity of one of the world’s poorest countries.","[1, 0, 2]","[9, 8, 7]"

The storm will most likely hit land around the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, before moving across the peninsula, bringing winds of up to 100 km/h (60 mph), Spain’s state weather service said.
Earlier this week, 12 people died in the flooding on Mallorca in the Mediterranean.
Currently a Category 1 hurricane, Leslie is expected to weaken slightly as it moves east on Saturday, the U.S. National Hurricane Centre (NHC) said.
As of Saturday afternoon, Leslie was about 200 miles (320 km) west of Lisbon, the NHC said, adding that it is expected to become a post-tropical cyclone and dissipate by Sunday night or Monday.
Spanish emergency services warned of the possibility of flash floods and urged to motorists to be vigilant in case of strong winds.
Separate storm fronts in the north and east of Spain mean heavy rain is expected across much of the country on Sunday.
Heavy rain hit Mallorca on Tuesday, sending torrents of brown water along narrow streets in the town of Sant Llorenc.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,More U.S. Aid Will Be Sought for Louisiana,"Facing complaints that it has not done enough to rebuild New Orleans, the Bush administration announced Wednesday that it would ask Congress for $4.2 billion more to compensate Louisiana residents whose homes were severely damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
The money will come from $18 billion that the administration said last month it would request from Congress this year for hurricane relief.
The announcement was praised by Louisiana officials who said that the $4.2 billion, when added to $7.7 billion in rebuilding money approved by Congress last year, would be enough to help anyone in the state who owned a storm-wrecked home.
""I am here to say a special thank you to the president,"" said Gov.
Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, who flew in for a news conference at the Capitol.
Ms. Blanco, a Democrat, had criticized the White House for falling short of President Bush's pledge to ""do what it takes"" to reconstruct New Orleans.
The $4.2 billion request was a turnabout for the administration, which three weeks ago rejected legislation proposed by Representative Richard H. Baker, a Louisiana Republican, to create a nonprofit group to buy out flooded homes, the plan favored by Ms. Blanco.
Louisiana officials had also complained that Congress had shortchanged the state in a $29 billion relief package in December that gave $5.2 billion in housing reconstruction money to Mississippi, which suffered far less damage than Louisiana but which has a Republican governor and two Republican senators.
Last week, Ms. Blanco threatened to try to block a federal sale of oil and gas leases off the Gulf Coast, saying it was ""time to play hardball.""
But in the past week, state officials said, Donald E. Powell, the president's coordinator for Gulf Coast rebuilding, became convinced that the federal government should do more to help homeowners in the flood plain who did not have flood insurance.
The $4.2 billion will be part of an $18 billion supplemental budget request for hurricane-related costs in the current fiscal year that the Bush administration expects to present to Congress this week.
The full request will include money for loans to help storm-damaged small businesses, to repair flood walls and to replenish the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster relief fund.
Officials in Louisiana and New Orleans had said more aid was needed to cover huge gaps between the cost of wind and flood damage from the two hurricanes and the amount that homeowners and landlords would receive in insurance payments.
Insurance industry analysts have estimated that the gap in coverage on houses and rental units totals $8.4 billion across the state, including $5.4 billion in New Orleans.
State officials had said they would need as much as $12 billion in assistance to rebuild houses, provide incentives to apartment developers and help compensate homeowners who choose to sell ruined homes at a loss.
Andrew Kopplin, executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, said about 100,000 severely damaged and 67,000 less-damaged homes in Louisiana would be the main beneficiaries of the money.
Mr. Kopplin said grants would be capped at $150,000 per home, less payments by FEMA and insurance companies.
The $4.2 billion plan does not include money for commercial property owners.
Insurance analysts estimate that the insurance shortfall totals $9.5 billion for state businesses ranging from small groceries to large corporations.
Relief for those businesses comes mainly from Small Business Administration loans, which so far total about $485 million.
The Bush administration had raised concerns about whether Louisiana had a clear plan for reconstruction and whether it could be held accountable for the huge influx of federal aid it was about to receive.
But on Wednesday, Mr. Powell said that he had become convinced that the state was addressing both issues.
Ms. Blanco said that on Monday the recovery authority would release spending guidelines for the federal aid, which will be given to the state in the form of community development block grants administered by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The guidelines will not be a detailed rebuilding plan for New Orleans, which is still being developed by a commission appointed by Mayor C. Ray Nagin.
Mr. Isaacson said the guidelines would make clear that only homes in certain neighborhoods would be eligible for money, which could include aid to help homeowners raise their homes and make them more flood- and hurricane-resistant.","['Facing complaints that it has not done enough to rebuild New Orleans, the Bush administration announced Wednesday that it would ask Congress for $4.2 billion more to compensate Louisiana residents whose homes were severely damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,UK distribution company Electrocomponents targets U.S. and German deals,"British industrial distribution company Electrocomponents (ECM.L) is looking at Germany and the United States for potential bolt-on acquisitions and views China as one of its “greatest investment opportunities” over the next five years.
Electrocomponents made its first acquisition in nearly two decades with its 88 million pound ($114.2 million) purchase of IESA and CEO Lindsley Ruth has now set his sights on gaining increased penetration in the United States and Germany.
“They’re two of the biggest markets in the world for the products that we sell,” Ruth told Reuters on Thursday after the company gave an upbeat results outlook.
The company, which owns the RS Components, IESA and Allied Electronics & Automation brands, forecast a 27 percent jump in half-year adjusted pretax profit led by strong sales in its RS Pro business.
Ruth’s turnaround plan since taking the helm in 2015 has propelled the company’s share price to levels last seen around the dot-com bubble, having plunged by 87 percent to 113 pence in 2009.
The shares were up 3.2 percent at 741.4 pence at 1056 GMT on Thursday.
Electrocomponents has been cutting costs and simplifying its structure, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, and finance chief David Egan said it plans to invest in both digital and customer acquisitions in the region.
“The investment is across Asia-Pacific, but with an emphasis on China,” he told Reuters.
The company has been beefing up RS Pro, its high-margin electric and automation tools business, and said the unit outperformed the group in the half year to Sept. 30, with like-for-like revenue growth of 12 percent.
The FTSE 250 company said it was on track to deliver 4 million pounds of cost savings in the current financial year.
Ruth, whose efforts have brought a threefold increase in like-for-like revenue and saw its Asia-Pacific operations return to profit in the second half of last year, said that the second phase of the turnaround process was almost complete.
“We are quite happy with where we are, but we are still not where we need to be,” Ruth said, adding that there is significant room for improvement, especially in China.
Asia-Pacific accounts for 13 percent of the company’s total revenue.","['British industrial distribution company Electrocomponents (ECM.L) is looking at Germany and the United States for potential bolt-on acquisitions and views China as one of its “greatest investment opportunities” over the next five years.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"European shares steady as trade talks, U.S. politics fuel uncertainty","European stock markets ended broadly flat on Wednesday in a session of choppy trading amidst trade talks between the U.S. and China and uncertainty over U.S. President Donald Trump’s legal woes.
The pan-European STOXX 600 was flat in percentage terms at its close as investors waited to see whether the United States and China could make progress towards resolving their trade conflict.
Political developments in the United States have had limited effects, at least so far.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations on Tuesday and former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty on charges of tax and bank fraud.
“Stock markets are mixed as trade talks still dominate the headlines,” David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said in a note.
While a rise in the oil price boosted oil stocks .SXEP and miners .SXPP also powered ahead, autos .SXAP were notable underperformers.
The sector dropped more than 3 percent and was on track for its biggest daily fall since the Brexit vote in June 2016 after automotive supplier Continental AG (CONG.DE) dropped more than 14 percent on the back of a profit warning.
Continental cut its 2018 sales and margin guidance, citing lower revenues, higher costs for developing hybrid and electric car technologies, and unspecified warranty claims.
“While most profit warnings are by definition a surprise, this one is all the more concerning as most of these headwinds were flagged and should have been evident when the company reported H2 results on 2 August; higher warranty costs being an exception,” analysts at Jefferies said in a note.
Elsewhere, shares in Belgian biopharma Argenx (ARGX.BR) rose 4.7 percent after Abbvie (ABBV.N) exercised an option to develop and commercialize a drug.
Among smaller companies, Adyen (ADYEN.AS), the Dutch company which processes payments for Netflix and Facebook, reported H1 profit up 75 percent and jumped 4.3 percent.
Though Atlantia (ATL.MI) rose earlier in the session, shares in the Italian infrastructure group declined steadily throughout the day and ended nearly 4 percent lower.
The group said it had started looking at the impact on its shares and bonds of government plans to strip it of its motorway concessions after the Genoa bridge collapse.
Linde (LING.DE) dipped 0.6 percent after warning that divestments needed to secure approval for its planned tie-up with Praxair had a size that would allow either party to abandon the deal.
The industrial gases supplier nevertheless added that it was in constructive talks to salvage the $83 billion merger.","['European stock markets ended broadly flat on Wednesday in a session of choppy trading amidst trade talks between the U.S. and China and uncertainty over U.S. President Donald Trump’s legal woes.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,U.S. Inquiry Backs Charges of Killing by Marines in Iraq,"An American government report on the killing of 24 Iraqis, including several women and children, by marines in the village of Haditha in 2005 provides new details of how the shootings unfolded and supports allegations by prosecutors that a few marines illegally killed civilians, government officials said yesterday.
The report, by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, contains thousands of pages of interviews with marines, Iraqi Army soldiers who had accompanied them and Iraqi villagers who had seen the attack.
The shootings followed a roadside bombing that killed a lance corporal and wounded two other marines, said a senior Defense Department official and another official who had read the report.
The evidence contained in the report, the most exhaustive of several inquiries begun by the military last year to determine what had happened in Haditha that day, led prosecutors to charge four enlisted marines with murder.
Four marine officers, who were not present during the attack, were charged with dereliction of duty and other crimes for failing to properly report details of the episode.
The details of the investigation, first reported by The Washington Post yesterday, corroborate accounts of how the killings took place over a period of hours, as described by senior military and Defense Department officials last year in The New York Times.
But the report broadly expands on those descriptions, and provides additional evidence, sworn testimony and accounts of witnesses that both prosecutors and lawyers for the accused marines are likely to use in upcoming courts-martial, officials said.
The four enlisted men charged with unpremeditated murder, all members of a squad of Company K, Third Battalion, First Marines, are Staff Sgt.
Frank D. Wuterich of Meriden, Conn.; Sgt.
Sanick P. Dela Cruz, 24, of Chicago; Lance Cpl.
Justin L. Sharratt, 22, of Carbondale, Pa.; and Lance Cpl.
Stephen B. Tatum, 25, of Edmond, Okla.
The attack on the Iraqis began after the roadside bomb blew up one of four Humvees the marines were traveling in on Nov. 19, 2005.
The report portrays Sergeant Wuterich, the squad leader, and Sergeant Dela Cruz as minutes later killing five men who had nervously piled out of a taxi that had stopped near the marine convoy, the officials said.
The men ""were shot by Wuterich as they stood, unarmed, next to the vehicle approximately 10 feet in front of him,"" the report said, according to a person who has read it.
Sergeant Dela Cruz said that as he approached the taxi, he saw some men standing near it with their hands in the air, officials said.
After Sergeant Wuterich shot them, he continued shooting as they lay on the ground, and later urinated on one of them, an official said.
The marines, taking small arms fire from several locations near homes on either side of the convoy, attacked a home nearby, killing six people, including a young boy, a woman and two elderly people, none of them armed, the report said, according to officials and people who have read it.
The report said that marines had told investigators who interviewed them months later that they believed they had permission from their superiors to fire at will inside that home and a second home they raided minutes later, officials said.
They said an officer, First Lt. William T. Kallop, who arrived with other marines after the roadside bomb to support the squad under fire, told them to commandeer one of the homes.
In one of the houses the marines raided, the report said, a 13-year-old girl, Safah Yunis Salem, said she had survived by pretending to be dead after marines killed several family members, including her 3-year-old sister and 5-year-old brother, government officials said.
One person who has read the N.C.I.S.
report and who is sympathetic to the marines' account of events said that the report's thousands of pages provide evidence for both prosecution and defense teams, and that drawing conclusions from the report about the guilt of any of the marines is difficult.
""For every statement that said X happened, there's another statement that said Y happened,"" this person said, speaking only after being granted anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the report.
An N.C.I.S.
spokesman declined to comment on the report, which it has not officially released, and said the agency was troubled by the leak of it to The Post.
""N.C.I.S.
strives to ensure the integrity of every investigation and finds the idea that someone might leak any of its investigative products to be deeply troubling,"" the spokesman said.
Several lawyers representing the marines expressed anger at the Defense Department, which they said had allowed the report to be given surreptitiously to a newspaper, potentially damaging their clients' cases.
""The defense lawyers are extremely upset,"" said Mark Zaid, a lawyer for Sergeant Wuterich, the squad leader who is charged with killing at least a dozen Iraqis.
""The release of the entire evidentiary set is unethical and appears to have been done by certain Pentagon officials with the intent to harm the defendants' defense.""
The report offers some contradictory evidence and omits other issues about how the marine chain of command handled the aftermath of the attack that have rankled certain people within the military and Defense Department.
One issue is the cash payments that commanders approved for families of people killed in the attacks.
Maj. Gen. Richard A. Huck, the commander of the Second Marine Division at the time, and Col. Stephen W. Davis, then the regimental commander, should have suspected the killings were improper, one Defense Department official said yesterday.
Though the Marine Corps' official view of the Haditha matter remained that 15 Iraqis had been killed by the roadside bomb, the corps nonetheless approved $2,500 for each of at least 15 families of people killed in the episode.
""The numbers simply never added up, and the Marines never acknowledged it,"" the Defense Department official said.

Correction: January 9, 2007, Tuesday An article on Sunday about marines charged in the killing of 24 Iraqis in the village of Haditha in November 2005 misidentified the Pennyslvania hometown of one marine because of information provided by his lawyer.","An American government report on the killing of 24 Iraqis, including several women and children, by marines in the village of Haditha in 2005 provides new details of how the shootings unfolded and supports allegations by prosecutors that a few marines illegally killed civilians, government officials said yesterday. The report, by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, contains thousands of pages of interviews with marines, Iraqi Army soldiers who had accompanied them and Iraqi villagers who had seen the attack. The shootings followed a roadside bombing that killed a lance corporal and wounded two other marines, said a senior Defense Department official and another official who had read the report. The evidence contained in the report, the most exhaustive of several inquiries begun by the military last year to determine what had happened in Haditha that day, led prosecutors to charge four enlisted marines with murder. Four marine officers, who were not present during the attack, were charged with dereliction of duty and other crimes for failing to properly report details of the episode. The details of the investigation, first reported by The Washington Post yesterday, corroborate accounts of how the killings took place over a period of hours, as described by senior military and Defense Department officials last year in The New York Times. But the report broadly expands on those descriptions, and provides additional evidence, sworn testimony and accounts of witnesses that both prosecutors and lawyers for the accused marines are likely to use in upcoming courts-martial, officials said. The four enlisted men charged with unpremeditated murder, all members of a squad of Company K, Third Battalion, First Marines, are Staff Sgt. Frank D. Wuterich of Meriden, Conn.; Sgt. Sanick P. Dela Cruz, 24, of Chicago; Lance Cpl. Justin L. Sharratt, 22, of Carbondale, Pa.; and Lance Cpl. Stephen B. Tatum, 25, of Edmond, Okla. The attack on the Iraqis began after the roadside bomb blew up one of four Humvees the marines were traveling in on Nov. 19, 2005. The report portrays Sergeant Wuterich, the squad leader, and Sergeant Dela Cruz as minutes later killing five men who had nervously piled out of a taxi that had stopped near the marine convoy, the officials said. The men ""were shot by Wuterich as they stood, unarmed, next to the vehicle approximately 10 feet in front of him,"" the report said, according to a person who has read it. Sergeant Dela Cruz said that as he approached the taxi, he saw some men standing near it with their hands in the air, officials said. After Sergeant Wuterich shot them, he continued shooting as they lay on the ground, and later urinated on one of them, an official said. The marines, taking small arms fire from several locations near homes on either side of the convoy, attacked a home nearby, killing six people, including a young boy, a woman and two elderly people, none of them armed, the report said, according to officials and people who have read it. The report said that marines had told investigators who interviewed them months later that they believed they had permission from their superiors to fire at will inside that home and a second home they raided minutes later, officials said. They said an officer, First Lt. William T. Kallop, who arrived with other marines after the roadside bomb to support the squad under fire, told them to commandeer one of the homes. In one of the houses the marines raided, the report said, a 13-year-old girl, Safah Yunis Salem, said she had survived by pretending to be dead after marines killed several family members, including her 3-year-old sister and 5-year-old brother, government officials said. One person who has read the N.C.I.S. report and who is sympathetic to the marines' account of events said that the report's thousands of pages provide evidence for both prosecution and defense teams, and that drawing conclusions from the report about the guilt of any of the marines is difficult. ""For every statement that said X happened, there's another statement that said Y happened,"" this person said, speaking only after being granted anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the report. An N.C.I.S. spokesman declined to comment on the report, which it has not officially released, and said the agency was troubled by the leak of it to The Post. ""N.C.I.S. strives to ensure the integrity of every investigation and finds the idea that someone might leak any of its investigative products to be deeply troubling,"" the spokesman said. Several lawyers representing the marines expressed anger at the Defense Department, which they said had allowed the report to be given surreptitiously to a newspaper, potentially damaging their clients' cases. ""The defense lawyers are extremely upset,"" said Mark Zaid, a lawyer for Sergeant Wuterich, the squad leader who is charged with killing at least a dozen Iraqis. ""The release of the entire evidentiary set is unethical and appears to have been done by certain Pentagon officials with the intent to harm the defendants' defense."" The report offers some contradictory evidence and omits other issues about how the marine chain of command handled the aftermath of the attack that have rankled certain people within the military and Defense Department. One issue is the cash payments that commanders approved for families of people killed in the attacks. Maj. Gen. Richard A. Huck, the commander of the Second Marine Division at the time, and Col. Stephen W. Davis, then the regimental commander, should have suspected the killings were improper, one Defense Department official said yesterday.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Venezuela says jailed lawmaker takes own life; opposition says he was killed,"Venezuela’s government said on Monday that a jailed opposition lawmaker killed himself by jumping from the 10th floor of the state intelligence agency headquarters (SEBIN) where he was being held, but his party said he was murdered by the government.
Municipal lawmaker Fernando Alban, 56, was jailed last Friday for alleged involvement in the explosion of two drones during a military parade in August that was led by President Nicolas Maduro, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said.
“At the moment he was going to be transported to court, while he was in the SEBIN waiting room, he jumped from the window of the building and fell, causing his death,” Reverol wrote in a post on Twitter.
That account differed from the one by Chief Prosecutor Tarek Saab, who said in televised statements that Alban had asked to use a bathroom and jumped from there.
The opposition First Justice party, for which Alban was a Caracas municipal counselor, said he was murdered.
“With great pain and thirst for justice we tell the people of Venezuela ... that Councilman Fernando Alban was murdered at the hands of the regime of Nicolas Maduro,” the party said.
First Justice’s national coordinator, Julio Borges, said Alban’s lifeless body was thrown from the SEBIN’s headquarters on Caracas’ Plaza Venezuela.
He did not provide any evidence and did he say what led him to believe that Alban was killed.
The party said that Alban’s arrest was owing to statements he made at recent United Nations meetings in New York City denouncing humans rights violations in Venezuela.
The government had previously given no reason for his arrest.
On Monday, Reverol said Alban had also been investigated for “destabilizing activities directed from abroad.”
The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Bob Corker, called on Maduro to explain the reasons for Alban’s death.
Corker was in Caracas on Monday to meet with government officials and the opposition to assess Venezuela’s economic crisis.
“This is disturbing and the government has a responsibility to ensure all understand how that could have happened,” Corker, a Republican, said on Twitter.
The United States imposed new sanctions on several of Maduro’s top allies last week as President Donald Trump urged UN members to support a “restoration of democracy” in Venezuela.
Alban’s assistant, Mileidy Blanco, said she had begged him to leave Venezuela with his family.
“And he didn’t do it.
He loved the country too much,” she said in an interview outside the SEBIN’s headquarters, known as “The Tomb” for its underground detention facility.
The opposition and rights groups have said that Maduro’s administration is holding hundreds of political prisoners on trumped-up charges intended to stifle dissent.
The United Nations has said detainees are often subjected to ill treatment, including some documented cases that amount to torture.
Authorities have arrested at least 30 people linked to the drone explosions on Aug. 2, which injured seven soldiers.
The government has denied that it is detaining people as political prisoners and has said that they were fairly jailed.
Alban’s lawyer, Joel Garcia, told reporters that when he last saw Alban on Sunday “he was not beaten, he was fine.” He said Alban told him that he had been interrogated but not tortured.
The Organization of American States (OAS) condemned Alban’s death.
“Direct responsibility of a regime that tortures and murders.
This criminal dictatorship must go now from Venezuela,” OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro said on Twitter.","['Venezuela’s government said on Monday that a jailed opposition lawmaker killed himself by jumping from the 10th floor of the state intelligence agency headquarters (SEBIN) where he was being held, but his party said he was murdered by the government.'

Venezuela’s government said on Monday that a jailed opposition lawmaker killed himself by jumping from the 10th floor of the state intelligence agency headquarters (SEBIN) where he was being held, but his party said he was murdered by the government. The party said that Alban’s arrest was owing to statements he made at recent United Nations meetings in New York City denouncing humans rights violations in Venezuela. He did not provide any evidence and did he say what led him to believe that Alban was killed. “With great pain and thirst for justice we tell the people of Venezuela ... that Councilman Fernando Alban was murdered at the hands of the regime of Nicolas Maduro,” the party said. The government had previously given no reason for his arrest. First Justice’s national coordinator, Julio Borges, said Alban’s lifeless body was thrown from the SEBIN’s headquarters on Caracas’ Plaza Venezuela. “This is disturbing and the government has a responsibility to ensure all understand how that could have happened,” Corker, a Republican, said on Twitter. The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Bob Corker, called on Maduro to explain the reasons for Alban’s death. Corker was in Caracas on Monday to meet with government officials and the opposition to assess Venezuela’s economic crisis. On Monday, Reverol said Alban had also been investigated for “destabilizing activities directed from abroad.” The United States imposed new sanctions on several of Maduro’s top allies last week as President Donald Trump urged UN members to support a “restoration of democracy” in Venezuela. “And he didn’t do it. He loved the country too much,” she said in an interview outside the SEBIN’s headquarters, known as “The Tomb” for its underground detention facility. The opposition and rights groups have said that Maduro’s administration is holding hundreds of political prisoners on trumped-up charges intended to stifle dissent. The United Nations has said detainees are often subjected to ill treatment, including some documented cases that amount to torture. Alban’s assistant, Mileidy Blanco, said she had begged him to leave Venezuela with his family. This criminal dictatorship must go now from Venezuela,” OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro said on Twitter. The Organization of American States (OAS) condemned Alban’s death. Alban’s lawyer, Joel Garcia, told reporters that when he last saw Alban on Sunday “he was not beaten, he was fine.” He said Alban told him that he had been interrogated but not tortured. Authorities have arrested at least 30 people linked to the drone explosions on Aug. 2, which injured seven soldiers. “Direct responsibility of a regime that tortures and murders. The government has denied that it is detaining people as political prisoners and has said that they were fairly jailed.","Venezuela’s government said on Monday that a jailed opposition lawmaker killed himself by jumping from the 10th floor of the state intelligence agency headquarters (SEBIN) where he was being held, but his party said he was murdered by the government.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Pakistani Army Says Its Forces Are Gaining in Tribal Lands,"After some of the heaviest fighting in two years in tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan's generals are claiming initial success in their latest efforts to combat foreign militants and regain some control in one of the most lawless regions.
President Pervez Musharraf acknowledged Thursday for the first time that the Pakistani military had been involved in the recent heavy fighting in the tribal area of South Waziristan and said that nearly 300 foreign militants had been killed.
The commander of Pakistani troops in the tribal areas, Maj. Gen. Gul Muhammad, put the figure much lower, at 150 to 200, in a briefing for journalists in Wana, the main town of South Waziristan, on Wednesday.
By some estimates only dozens have been killed.
Foreign journalists are not permitted to visit the tribal areas, except a few selected ones under strictly controlled visits, and there has been no independent verification of casualty figures.
The military does appear to have gained more control in the immediate region of Wana, and General Muhammad said the progress made in clearing the area of foreign militants -- mainly Uzbeks and other Central Asians who have been allied with Al Qaeda -- would serve as a model to use in the rest of the region, including the equally lawless North Waziristan next door.
Pakistan has been under heavy pressure from the United States and NATO countries to contain the spreading lawlessness of its tribal areas which Pakistani, Afghan and foreign militants have been using to wage an expanding insurgency across the border in Afghanistan.
South Waziristan had become a Taliban state in all but name after a peace deal with militants in 2005 gave them freedom to operate while the military withdrew to its barracks.
The Pakistani military abandoned broad-scale military operations in favor of negotiated peace deals with the militants over the past two years.
The strategy has been criticized for allowing militants a haven to regroup and increase their attacks across the border in Afghanistan and possibly farther afield.
The military has now set upon a third way to tackle the problem of militancy in its tribal regions, backing local armed tribesmen who have turned against the foreigners and their local protectors.
A rift emerged between a local commander and Uzbek fighters in his region in November and the military, and intelligence agencies admit they have sought to exploit the growing animosity among the local tribespeople toward the foreign militants, whom they accused of thuggery, robberies and murders.
""It's indigenous and it's picking up momentum,"" General Muhammad said.
""It's a homegrown affair.""
In a speech at a military conference in Islamabad on Thursday, President Musharraf said: ""The people of South Waziristan now have risen against the foreigners.
They have killed about 300 of them, and they got support from the Pakistan Army.
They asked for support.""
Military and paramilitary forces have moved in and occupied strategic hilltops and ridges in several areas that were until now controlled by militants in Shin Warsak, Kalosha and Tora Gola, General Muhammad said.
The immediate Wana region was almost clear of Uzbek militants, and tribal volunteers were chasing them in Nandran, a mountainous area near the Afghan border.
Even as it explains the recent developments as a homegrown uprising, the government is claiming credit for the shift in tribal dynamics as a result of its three-pronged strategy, referred to by General Muhammad as coercive deployment, political engagement and socio-economic development, to ""win over the hearts and minds of the people.""
Yet it remains unclear whether all is as the military says.
Promised meetings with members of the political administration of South Waziristan and with tribal elders did not materialize on the journalists' visit to the region Wednesday.
And while the military has tried to depict the fighting as local tribespeople moving against the foreigners, in fact it has been led by a Pakistani Taliban commander, Maulavi Nazir, who has close links to the Afghan Taliban and Arab members of Al Qaeda.
One of his accusations against the Uzbek group of militants has been that they did not want to fight foreign troops in Afghanistan, but preferred to attack pro-American Pakistanis, whether tribal elders or government members.
Answering a volley of questions regarding Mr. Nazir, General Muhammad said only that the militant commander was subservient to his tribe and not above it.
Hundreds of foreign militants remain in the region, probably including the leaders of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al- Zawahri, officials admit.
""It will take time,"" the general said.
""There are no quick fixes in this war.
We are here for a long haul.""","[""After some of the heaviest fighting in two years in tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan's generals are claiming initial success in their latest efforts to combat foreign militants and regain some control in one of the most lawless regions.""

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Heavy rain floods critical care unit at Indian hospital,"Heavy rains flooded a hospital critical care unit in eastern India, an official said on Monday, as annual monsoon rains destroyed homes in several parts of the country and forced others to flee to higher ground.
Television showed doctors wading through knee-deep water tending to patients lying on raised beds at the government Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) in Patna, the capital of Bihar state.
Some patients had been moved out as staff pumped out water that had seeped into medical equipment.
More than 1,500 people have died so far this year across the country due to storms, floods and landslides.
Most government action in India tends to focus on relief, with weak early warning systems and too little focus on prevention.
More rain is forecast for Bihar and neighboring Uttar Pradesh where 80 people have died over the last four days, either drowning or being hit by collapsing walls.
Rivers running through Uttar Pradesh were in spate.
“The next one week is critical.
If the water level rises consistently...definitely we will have a flood scenario,” said state relief commissioner Sanjay Kumar.
More than 10,000 people who lived near the banks of the Yamuna river in and around Delhi have been shifted to tents on higher ground as the water level crossed the danger mark, district magistrate K.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,COURT IN VENEZUELA ORDERS RELEASE OF A JUDGE SCORNED BY CH Á VEZ,"During the three and a half years that she was held in prison or under house arrest, Judge Lourdes Afiuni became a symbol of political persecution for many in Venezuela under President Hugo Chávez.
On Friday, a court in Caracas, acting at the government’s request, ordered Afiuni to be set free in the latest sign of a shifting political landscape in post-Chávez Venezuela.
Afiuni was jailed in December 2009 after issuing a court ruling that infuriated Chávez, who went on television and demanded that she be sentenced to 30 years in prison.
For years Chávez ignored international appeals for her release, including from the American leftist intellectual Noam Chomsky.
Chávez, a charismatic socialist, died in March, leaving a bitterly divided country.
His handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro, was elected by a slim margin in April and since then has confronted political turmoil and serious economic difficulties that have tested his nascent leadership skills.
As Maduro lurches from one crisis to the next, the quality he seems to have honed most is delivering mixed messages at top volume.
He branded President Barack Obama “the big boss of the devils” and then sent his foreign minister to shake hands with Secretary of State John Kerry and call for warmer relations.
He assailed capitalists for causing soaring inflation and rampant product shortages and then sat down with the head of the country’s biggest private company to discuss the economy.
“There are lots of mixed signals,” said Elsa Cardozo, a professor of political science at the Central University of Venezuela.
“It is clear the government of President Maduro is in a situation that is forcing it to make some changes in direction.
What we don’t know is if they are permanent changes or tactical changes.”
Afiuni’s release may actually be intended to counter an opposition campaign to take its message abroad, with leaders visiting countries around the world to make the case that Maduro was unfairly declared the winner of a flawed election and that his government is repressive.
The opposition routinely points to Afiuni as the most prominent among a group of what it calls political prisoners.
Her lawyer, José Amalio Graterol, confirmed reports last year that she was raped while in prison, became pregnant and had an abortion, which led to other health problems.
She was moved to house arrest in Caracas in 2011.
Afiuni’s trial began in November and is continuing, although she has not attended it.","['During the three and a half years that she was held in prison or under house arrest, Judge Lourdes Afiuni became a symbol of political persecution for many in Venezuela under President Hugo Chávez.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Thai junta chief eyes role in politics after election,"Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha is “interested in politics,” he said on Monday, a sign that he sees a public role for himself after a general election promised next year.
May next year is the most recent deadline Prayuth’s junta has set for a vote its critics hope will return Thailand to civilian rule after more than four years of military rule, although it has repeatedly pushed back the timeline.
Critics say the military aims to maintain its grip on power beyond the election and they point to a military-backed constitution that limits the authority of civilian politicians.
“I can say right now that I am interested in politics,” Prayuth, who has previously sidestepped questions about his political future, told reporters on Monday.
“Because I love my country, like all Thai people,” he said.
He did not elaborate on his comments.
As army chief, Prayuth, 64, led a 2014 coup that ousted a civilian government to end a prolonged period of sometimes deadly unrest.
Technically Prayuth cannot stand for election under the constitution, because he would have had to resign from his post since 2017 to do so.
Prayuth said on Monday he did not intend to quit as junta chief.
However, Prayuth could return as prime minister if a political party nominated him as its frontrunner.
The constitution offers Prayuth another route.
He could be chosen as an “outside prime minister” if 500 members, or two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the Upper House Senate, voted to kickstart the process, if the winning party’s candidate failed to get enough votes.
Watana Muangsook, a member of the opposition Puea Thai Party, welcomed Prayuth’s participation in the next election but said he must first give up his post as junta chief.
“You may join whichever party, but you should resign as junta chief to lay down your weapons and play fair like everybody else,” Watana told Reuters.
The junta, formally known as the National Council for Peace and Order, has promised to relax its curbs on political activities before the vote, to allow political parties to complete administrative tasks between September and December.","['Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha is “interested in politics,” he said on Monday, a sign that he sees a public role for himself after a general election promised next year.'

The junta, formally known as the National Council for Peace and Order, has promised to relax its curbs on political activities before the vote, to allow political parties to complete administrative tasks between September and December.","May next year is the most recent deadline Prayuth’s junta has set for a vote its critics hope will return Thailand to civilian rule after more than four years of military rule, although it has repeatedly pushed back the timeline. Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha is “interested in politics,” he said on Monday, a sign that he sees a public role for himself after a general election promised next year. Critics say the military aims to maintain its grip on power beyond the election and they point to a military-backed constitution that limits the authority of civilian politicians. He did not elaborate on his comments. “Because I love my country, like all Thai people,” he said. “I can say right now that I am interested in politics,” Prayuth, who has previously sidestepped questions about his political future, told reporters on Monday. Technically Prayuth cannot stand for election under the constitution, because he would have had to resign from his post since 2017 to do so. Prayuth said on Monday he did not intend to quit as junta chief. As army chief, Prayuth, 64, led a 2014 coup that ousted a civilian government to end a prolonged period of sometimes deadly unrest. The constitution offers Prayuth another route. He could be chosen as an “outside prime minister” if 500 members, or two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the Upper House Senate, voted to kickstart the process, if the winning party’s candidate failed to get enough votes. However, Prayuth could return as prime minister if a political party nominated him as its frontrunner. “You may join whichever party, but you should resign as junta chief to lay down your weapons and play fair like everybody else,” Watana told Reuters. Watana Muangsook, a member of the opposition Puea Thai Party, welcomed Prayuth’s participation in the next election but said he must first give up his post as junta chief.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Tsunami hits Japan after strong quake near Fukushima disaster site,"A powerful earthquake rocked northern Japan early on Tuesday, briefly disrupting cooling functions at a nuclear plant and generating a small tsunami that hit the same Fukushima region devastated by a 2011 quake, tsunami and nuclear disaster.
The magnitude 7.4 earthquake, which was felt in Tokyo, sent thousands of residents fleeing for higher ground as dawn broke along the northeastern coast.
There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries hours after the quake hit at 5:59 a.m. (2059 GMT Monday).
It was centered off the coast of Fukushima prefecture at a depth of about 10 kilometers (6 miles), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said.
A wave of up to 1.4 meters (4.5 ft) high was recorded at Sendai, about 70 km (45 miles) north of Fukushima, with smaller waves hitting ports elsewhere along the coast, public broadcaster NHK said.
Television footage showed ships moving out to sea from harbors as tsunami warnings wailed after alerts of waves of up to 3 meters (10 feet) were issued.
“We saw high waves but nothing that went over the tidal barriers,” a man in the city of Iwaki told NTV television network.
Aerial footage showed tsunami waves flowing up rivers in some areas, and some fishing boats were overturned in the port of Higashi-Matsushima before the JMA lifted its warnings.
The U.S. Geological Survey measured Tuesday’s quake at magnitude 6.9, down from an initial 7.3.
All Japan’s nuclear power plants in the area have been shut down in the wake of the March 2011 disaster, which knocked out cooling systems at Tokyo Electric Power Co’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, causing reactors to melt down and spew radiation into the air, soil and sea.
The cooling system for a storage pool for spent nuclear fuel at the reactor at its Fukushima Daini Plant was initially halted on Tuesday, said a spokeswoman for Tokyo Electric Power, known as Tepco, but was restarted soon after.
Only two reactors are operating in Japan, both in the southwest.
Nuclear plants need cooling systems operating even when in shutdown to keep spent fuel cool.
Tohoku Electric Power Co said there was no damage to its Onagawa nuclear plant, while the Kyodo news agency reported there were no irregularities at the Tokai Daini nuclear plant in Ibaraki prefecture.
COAST EVACUATED
Japanese Minister for Disaster Management Jun Matsumoto told reporters there had been no reports of significant injuries.
One woman suffered cuts to her head from falling dishes, Kyodo reported, citing fire department officials.
Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world’s most seismically active areas.
Japan accounts for about 20 percent of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.
The March 11, 2011, quake was magnitude 9, the strongest quake ever recorded in Japan.
The massive tsunami it generated knocked out the Fukushima Daiichi plant, causing the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl a quarter of a century earlier.
Systems have been updated since the 2011 disaster to spread warnings more quickly, said Tsunetaka Omine, head of the Disaster Management Division in Iwaki, a city in Fukushima prefecture.
Previously, there were complicated directions on where to evacuate.
“But now, we basically just tell people to head away from the sea, to the highest possible ground,” Omine said.
Authorities now also send tsunami warnings to every mobile phone in the area and broadcast on local radio.
Staying in a traditional Japanese inn on the coast in the city of Ofunato with a dozen international high school students on a study tour, teacher Kathy Krauth said the shaking began just seconds after a quake alarm on her phone went off.
“I felt like the lessons of 3-11 were really taken to heart,” said Krauth, who teaches a class on the March 2011 disaster and its aftermath.
“The feeling was, we just don’t know, but we’re going to be as cautious as we can.”
Nissan Motor Co said it would suspend work at its engine factory in Fukushima at least until the latest tsunami warning was lifted.
A spokesman said there were no injuries or damage at the plant, which was badly damaged in the 2011 disaster.
Toyota Motor Corp said all its factories in northeastern Japan were operating as usual.
Japan’s famous Shinkansen bullet trains were halted along one stretch of track and some other train lines were also stopped.
Japanese financial markets were little affected, with the Nikkei 225 index closing up 0.3 percent and the yen steady against the U.S. dollar.","['A powerful earthquake rocked northern Japan early on Tuesday, briefly disrupting cooling functions at a nuclear plant and generating a small tsunami that hit the same Fukushima region devastated by a 2011 quake, tsunami and nuclear disaster.'

COAST EVACUATED The March 11, 2011, quake was magnitude 9, the strongest quake ever recorded in Japan. Previously, there were complicated directions on where to evacuate. All Japan’s nuclear power plants in the area have been shut down in the wake of the March 2011 disaster, which knocked out cooling systems at Tokyo Electric Power Co’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, causing reactors to melt down and spew radiation into the air, soil and sea. A spokesman said there were no injuries or damage at the plant, which was badly damaged in the 2011 disaster. Authorities now also send tsunami warnings to every mobile phone in the area and broadcast on local radio. “We saw high waves but nothing that went over the tidal barriers,” a man in the city of Iwaki told NTV television network. Staying in a traditional Japanese inn on the coast in the city of Ofunato with a dozen international high school students on a study tour, teacher Kathy Krauth said the shaking began just seconds after a quake alarm on her phone went off. A powerful earthquake rocked northern Japan early on Tuesday, briefly disrupting cooling functions at a nuclear plant and generating a small tsunami that hit the same Fukushima region devastated by a 2011 quake, tsunami and nuclear disaster. Japan’s famous Shinkansen bullet trains were halted along one stretch of track and some other train lines were also stopped. Tohoku Electric Power Co said there was no damage to its Onagawa nuclear plant, while the Kyodo news agency reported there were no irregularities at the Tokai Daini nuclear plant in Ibaraki prefecture. Japan accounts for about 20 percent of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater. There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries hours after the quake hit at 5:59 a.m. (2059 GMT Monday). Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world’s most seismically active areas. Systems have been updated since the 2011 disaster to spread warnings more quickly, said Tsunetaka Omine, head of the Disaster Management Division in Iwaki, a city in Fukushima prefecture. It was centered off the coast of Fukushima prefecture at a depth of about 10 kilometers (6 miles), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said. Toyota Motor Corp said all its factories in northeastern Japan were operating as usual. A wave of up to 1.4 meters (4.5 ft) high was recorded at Sendai, about 70 km (45 miles) north of Fukushima, with smaller waves hitting ports elsewhere along the coast, public broadcaster NHK said. Nissan Motor Co said it would suspend work at its engine factory in Fukushima at least until the latest tsunami warning was lifted. Japanese financial markets were little affected, with the Nikkei 225 index closing up 0.3 percent and the yen steady against the U.S. dollar. The U.S. Geological Survey measured Tuesday’s quake at magnitude 6.9, down from an initial 7.3. “But now, we basically just tell people to head away from the sea, to the highest possible ground,” Omine said. The magnitude 7.4 earthquake, which was felt in Tokyo, sent thousands of residents fleeing for higher ground as dawn broke along the northeastern coast.

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Metro puts struggling Real hypermarket chain on the block,"German retailer Metro AG plans to sell its struggling Real hypermarkets and is confident of interest in the chain, though bankers played down talk it might attract Amazon and a price tag of up to 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion).
Industry bankers contacted by Reuters said private equity firms were the most likely bidders and that Metro might have to effectively pay a buyer to take the chain off its hands.
Foreign players have shunned the cut-throat German grocery market, which is dominated by discounters Aldi and Lidl, since Walmart took a loss of $1 billion when it sold its stores to Metro and pulled out of the country in 2006.
Metro says it wants to focus on its wholesale business which serves independent traders, hotels and restaurants and is more shielded from ecommerce, while doing more delivery to customers.
“The fact that we repeatedly had expressions of interest shows that we can take up the journey again,” Metro’s chief executive Olaf Koch told journalists on Friday.
Metro previously tried to sell Real in 2012 and a consortium of Apollo and Towerbrook made an offer, as did KKR, before the retailer opted instead to restructure the chain.
Koch expected the sales process to take up to eight months.
HSBC’s European retail analyst, Andrew Porteous, welcomed the plan and raised his price target for Metro shares to 14 euros from 11.50 euros.
“Increased focus is a positive,” he said in a note.
“We have consistently held that Metro needed to simplify in order to create value.”
Large European retailers such as Ahold, Carrefour, Auchan, Tesco are unlikely to bid for Real, people familiar with the industry said.
The chain may attract more interest from investors such as Apollo-backed Alteri, owner of Babywalz and CBR Fashion Group or from other private equity firms.
Buyout groups, have had mixed results though with retail in Germany and several deals - such as Sun Capital’s Neckermann investment - have turned sour.
Some analysts speculated Amazon could be interested after its acquisition of U.S. grocery chain Whole Foods last year.
Germany is its second biggest market after the United States.
“Germany’s grocery ecommerce is very underdeveloped and Germany is a very important country for Amazon,” said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, adding a price of around 1 billion euros would be no hurdle for the ecommerce giant.
An Amazon spokesman declined to comment and the buyout groups named either declined to comment or were not immediately available.
FINDING A BUYER
Real has suffered from tough competition from the advance of online players like Amazon and has sought to build up an online grocery business in recent years.
Its ecommerce still only accounts for 2 percent of its 7.2 billion euro sales.
The business posted a loss and saw sales slide 7.2 percent in the latest quarter, which it blamed on an early Easter and unusually hot weather.
Bankers do not view Real as high on Amazon’s shopping list.
One said Real could be sold for “near zero at best”, while another said Metro may have to pay to offload the business.
Koch said selling Real was not connected to Daniel Kretinsky buying a stake in Metro last month, although he said the company had met the Czech billionaire, whose move prompted speculation he could make a full bid and take Metro private.
Analysts said a financial investor might be interested in the real estate value of the 65 hypermarkets that Real owns, while other options could be a sale of parcels of stores to chains like Lidl or dominant supermarket group Edeka.
However, peers need to tread carefully to avoid anti-trust concerns like those that dogged Edeka’s purchase of loss-making chain Kaiser’s in 2015.
One of the bankers said fellow German supermarket chain Kaufland, held by Lidl owner Schwarz Group, could show an interest in some sites.
Koch told journalists the aim was to sell Real as a whole rather than as a bundle of stores.
Trade union Verdi criticized Metro’s treatment of Real’s 34,000 workers in recent years and said the company should be sold as a whole.
“First the workforce forwent part of their wages ... then the company shredded the collective bargaining agreement, and now Real is going to be sold,” said Stefanie Nutzenberger from Verdi.
In focusing its business, Metro has already sold its Kaufhof department stores and split from consumer electronics retailer Ceconomy.
Real’s stores in eastern Europe were sold to French retailer Auchan in 2012.
Metro’s shares closed down 1.2 percent in Frankfurt at 13.51 euros.","['German retailer Metro AG plans to sell its struggling Real hypermarkets and is confident of interest in the chain, though bankers played down talk it might attract Amazon and a price tag of up to 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion).'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"Kennedy cousin's murder conviction overturned, new trial ordered","A divided Connecticut Supreme Court on Friday threw out the 2002 murder conviction of Michael Skakel, a member of the Kennedy family, and ordered a new trial.
The 4-3 decision upheld a lower court judge’s 2013 ruling that Skakel’s lawyer did not provide an adequate defense, necessitating a new trial on charges that he killed his neighbor Martha Moxley at her Greenwich home in 1975.
Justice Richard Palmer, writing for the majority, said the trial lawyer had failed to present the jury with testimony from a witness who could have provided an alibi for Skakel.
Palmer said the prosecutors’ case was “far from strong,” and the outcome might have been different with the alibi testimony.
“This has been a long road for Michael, and we are grateful to the court for its ruling today,” said Hubert Santos, Skakel’s lawyer in the appeal.
Skakel, a cousin of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and nephew of Ethel Kennedy, the widow of U.S.
Senator Robert F. Kennedy, was sentenced to 20 years in prison before he was freed on bail when state Superior Court Judge Thomas Bishop ruled that his attorney had failed to provide an effective trial defense.
In 2016, the Connecticut Supreme Court rejected Bishop’s conclusion and reinstated Skakel’s conviction, prompting Santos to ask the court to reconsider its decision.
Since the 2016 ruling, one justice in the majority retired and was replaced by another justice, who voted in favor of ordering a new trial, thus flipping the court’s decision.
In a dissenting opinion, Justice Carmen Espinosa said Skakel’s decision to file a motion for reconsideration after a justice’s retirement amounted to “judge shopping.”
A spokesman for the Connecticut chief state’s attorney’s office, which argued against Skakel’s appeal in court, said the office was reviewing the decision.
The case drew enormous media attention, both because of the connection to the Kennedys and because the murder took place in Greenwich, one of New York City’s toniest suburbs.
Moxley was found bludgeoned to death with a golf club, later traced to a set owned by Skakel’s mother, when she and Skakel were both 15 years old.
The case was unsolved for more than 20 years.
In 1998, former Los Angeles police detective Mark Fuhrman, known for his role in the O.J.
Simpson murder case, wrote a book implicating Skakel.
A grand jury was convened that year, and Skakel was charged in 2000.","['A divided Connecticut Supreme Court on Friday threw out the 2002 murder conviction of Michael Skakel, a member of the Kennedy family, and ordered a new trial.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,Super typhoon slams into China after pummelling Philippines,"A super typhoon made landfall in China’s Guangdong on Sunday, the country’s most populous province, after wreaking havoc in Hong Kong and Macau and killing potentially more than 50 people in the Philippines.
Packing winds of more than 200 kph (125 mph) at its peak, tropical cyclone Mangkhut is considered the strongest to hit the region this year.
Its strength outstripped that of Hurricane Florence, which achieved maximum sustained winds of 150 kph (90 mph) when it roared into North Carolina in the United States on Friday.
The eye of Mangkhut, the Thai name for Southeast Asia’s mangosteen fruit, skirted 100 kms (62 miles) south of Hong Kong but the former British colony was still caught in the typhoon’s swirling bands of rain and gale-force winds.
Hong Kong raised its highest No.
10 typhoon signal mid-morning as ferocious winds uprooted trees and smashed windows in office and residential buildings, some of which swayed in the gusts, residents said.
“It swayed for quite a long time, at least two hours.
It made me feel so dizzy,” said Elaine Wong, who lives in a high-rise tower in Kowloon.
Water levels surged 3.5 m (12 ft) in some places and waves swamped roads and threw up live fish, washing into some residential blocks and a mall in the eastern Heng Fa Chuen district.
“It’s the worst I’ve seen,” resident Martin Wong told Reuters.
“I’ve not seen the roads flood like this (and) the windows shake like this before.”
Flight cancellations at Hong Kong’s international airport, a major regional hub, disrupted the plans of tens of thousands of travellers.
Airlines such as flagship carrier Cathay Pacific (0293.HK) cancelled many flights last week.
In the Philippines, casualties reported by various agencies on Sunday evening indicate the death toll from the impact of Mangkhut could exceed 50, with most killed in landslides in or near mountainous areas of the Cordillera region.
Francis Tolentino, an advisor to President Rodrigo Duterte and head of the government’s disaster coordination, said the latest number of casualties was 33 dead and 56 missing.
But the head of the military’s Northern Luzon Command, Emmanuel Salamat, told Reuters that at least 19 more were killed in landslides in one part of Benguet province.
The 19 who died were part of a bigger group of 43 people, likely miners, and those who were still alive were feared to be trapped in an old mining bunkhouse that had collapsed under rubble, Salamat said.
Search and rescue missions were ongoing, and a local mayor in Benguet, Victorio Palangdan, said he feared the number killed there could be more than 100.
Separately, the coastguard said it had recovered the bodies of three people.
In Macau, which took the unprecedented step of halting casino gambling late on Saturday, there was serious flooding of up to 2.5 metres, authorities said, with some people having to be rescued from homes on rubber dinghies.
“The suspension is for the safety of casino employees, visitors to the city, and residents,” said authorities in the world’s largest gambling hub, who faced criticism last year after a typhoon that killed nine and caused severe damage.
Around 20,000 Macau households also suffered a power blackout, local media reported.

“KING OF STORMS”
The typhoon, dubbed the “King of Storms” by Chinese media, made landfall in Haiyan town at 5 p.m. local time, weather officials said.
Ports, oil refineries and industrial plants in the area have been shut.
Power to some areas was also reduced as a precaution.
In Shenzhen, the electricity supply to more than 130,000 homes was cut at one point on Sunday.
The storm has fuelled concern about sugar production in Guangdong, which accounts for a tenth of national output at about 1 million tonnes.
China sugar futures CSRcv1 rose last week on fears for the cane crop.
Guangdong is also China’s most populous province, with a population of more than 100 million.
According to state media, two people were killed in Guangdong due to the typhoon as of 8:00 p.m. local time.
More than 2.45 million people have been relocated and over 48,000 fishing boats called back to port in the province.
Work at more than 29,000 construction sites has been suspended.
State television showed scenes of crashing waves, inundated streets and trees half-bent by the strong winds as Mangkhut unleashed its power.
Shenzhen airport, shut since midnight, will be closed until 8:00 a.m. (2400 GMT) on Monday.
Flights have also been cancelled in Guangzhou and the island of Hainan, China’s southernmost province.
High winds and swells also hit Fujian province north of Guangdong, shutting ports, suspending ferry services and cancelling more than 100 flights.
Waves as high as 7.3 metres (24 ft) were sighted in the Taiwan Strait, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
Travelling at 30 kph (19 mph), Mangkhut will continue on its northwesterly track, bringing heavy rain and winds to the autonomous region of Guangxi early on Monday.
It is expected to weaken into a tropical depression when it reaches southwestern Yunnan province the early hours of Tuesday.","['A super typhoon made landfall in China’s Guangdong on Sunday, the country’s most populous province, after wreaking havoc in Hong Kong and Macau and killing potentially more than 50 people in the Philippines.'

The official death toll from the 7.5 magnitude quake that hit the west coast of Sulawesi island last Friday rose to 1,407, many killed by tsunami waves it triggered.
But officials fear the toll could soar, as most of the confirmed dead have come from Palu, a small city 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta, and losses in remote areas remain unknown, as communications are down, and bridges and roads have been destroyed or blocked by landslides.
National disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said most of the aid effort had been concentrated in Palu, where electricity supply has yet to be restored.
But rescue workers have begun to reach more remote areas in a disaster zone that encompasses 1.4 million people.
Johnny Lim, a restaurant owner reached by telephone in Donggala town, said he was surviving on coconuts.
“It’s a zombie town.
Everything’s destroyed.
Nothing’s left,” Lim said over a crackling line.
“We’re on our last legs.
There’s no food, no water.”
In another part of Donggala district, which has a population of 300,000 people, Ahmad Derajat, said survivors were scavenging for food in fields and orchards.
“What we’re relying on right now is food from farms and sharing whatever we find like sweet potatoes or bananas,” said Derajat whose house was swept away by the tsunami leaving a jumble of furniture, collapsed tin roofs and wooden beams.
“Why aren’t they dropping aid by helicopter?” he asked.
Aid worker Lian Gogali described a perilous situation in Donggala, which includes a string of cut-off, small towns along a coast road north of Palu close to the quake’s epicenter.
“Everyone is desperate for food and water.
There’s no food, water, or gasoline.
The government is missing,” Gogali said, adding that her aid group had only been able to send in a trickle of rations by motorbike.
Underlining a growing sense of urgency, President Widodo made his second visit to the disaster zone, putting on an orange hard hat to talk to rescue workers at a collapsed hotel in Palu.
“What I’ve observed after returning now is heavy equipment has arrived, logistics have started to arrive although it’s not at maximum yet, fuel has partly arrived,” Widodo told reporters.
‘PRESIDENT NOT HEARING’
Widodo, who will seek re-election next year, called on Tuesday for reinforcements in the search for victims, saying everyone had to be found.
He repeated that on Wednesday, after inspecting what he called an “evacuation” effort at the Hotel Roa Roa, where he said some 30 people lay buried in the ruins.
Yahdi Basma, a leader from a village south of Palu hoping to get his family on a cargo plane out, said Widodo had no idea of the extent of the suffering.
“The president is not hearing about the remote areas, only about the tsunami and about Palu,” he said.
“There are hundreds of people still buried under the mud in my village ...
There is no aid whatsoever which is why we’re leaving.”
At least seven cargo planes arrived at Palu airport earlier on Wednesday carrying tonnes of aid, some bedecked in the red and white national colors and stamped with the presidential office seal declaring: “Assistance from the President of Republic of Indonesia”.
The quake brought down hotels, shopping malls and thousands of houses in Palu, while tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) scoured its beachfront shortly afterwards.
About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood were swallowed up by ground liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid, and hundreds of people are believed to have perished, the disaster agency said.
Indonesian Red Cross disaster responders said the village of Petobo, just south of Palu, which was home to almost 500 people, had been “wiped off the map”.
“They are finding devastation and tragedy everywhere,” Iris van Deinse, of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said in a statement.
Nearby, rescue workers, some using an excavator, were searching for 52 children missing since liquefaction destroyed their bible study camp.
Bodies of 35 of the children have been found.
Aircraft, tents, water treatment facilities and generators were the main needs for survivors including more than 70,000 displaced people, according to the national disaster mitigation agency spokesman.
Sitting on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to quakes and tsunamis.
A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.
Adding to Sulawesi’s woes, the Soputan volcano in the north of the island, 600 km (375 miles) northeast of Palu, erupted on Wednesday but there were no reports of casualties or damage.","['Hungry survivors of an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia said on Wednesday they were scavenging for food in farms as President Joko Widodo made a second visit to the area to ramp up aid efforts five days after disaster struck.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,News Analysis: Why does U.S. push urgently for peace process in Yemen now?,"The United States has been mounting pressure to bring an end to the war in Yemen that is pitting its close allies in the Saudi-led coalition against Iranian-allied Shiite Houthi rebels.
After more than three years of devastating war that killed thousands and brought the whole Yemeni nation to the brink of starvation, why is the United States stepping up its pressures now?
The U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis has called for ""immediate end"" to the war in Yemen.
""It looks like very, very early in December up in Sweden we'll see both the Houthi rebel side and the Saudi-backed government of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi will be up there,"" Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon last week.
Mattis' words were quickly backed by the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
In the U.S. Congress, many senators have risen their voices to end the U.S. military support to Saudi Arabia, increasing pressure on Trump administration to end the war in Yemen.
They are now preparing to pass a legislation to completely end the U.S. military assistance to Saudi Arabia.
Also, many European countries, including France, have backed the calls for ending the conflict in Yemen.
Some European governments announced a pause of their weapon sales to Saudi Arabia.
Britain sent its Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to Riyadh to press for an end to the Yemen's war.
Now, after such unprecedented push, the United Nations is well confident that all rival parties to the conflict will engage in those upcoming peace process.
These accelerating moves are raising a question, why now?
""The U.S. diplomatic movements have begun in early October, after the Western media began to learn about details of the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi,"" said Abdelelah Haidar, a Yemeni political analyst and an expert on the U.S. political issues based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident, who was a journalist for The Washington Post, was reportedly assassinated inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
The Saudi government has since been facing increasing pressure to disclose the perpetrators behind the murder of Khashoggi, as well as to end its war in Yemen.
""It appeared to be a U.S. military decision by the Pentagon chief Mattis as he was the first U.S. official to demand an immediate end to the Saudi-led coalition war in Yemen,"" Haidar told Xinhua.
Before Mattis' move, many voices in the Congress, which are very critical to the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, have increasingly demanded the punishment against the murders of Khashoggi and called for an end to the Yemen's war.
""The victory of democrats in the midterm elections in the Congress in late October has sped up the pressure on Trump's administration,"" Haidar said.
""The democratic's senators were backed by a large-scale support from the leading U.S. media outlets, which focused on the Saudi-led coalition war in Yemen and linked it with the murder of Khashoggi,"" he said.
""I think, the Congress' pressure is targeting Trump himself ... it targeted the personal business relationship between Trump, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and the Saudi royal family,"" Haidar said.
Analyst Adel al-Assar of Sanaa-based daily Althawra newspaper said that ""all comes together, the Congress' actions and U.S. media reports on Yemen's war, to put Trump administration to do something.""
""The democrats in the Congress are preparing to move ahead toward a complete cut of the U.S. military assistance to Saudi Arabia,"" al-Assar said.
""So, Trump and Kushner have their own personal motive to save Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom they have a very special friendship,"" he added.
The Congress' movements and Trump's ""personal motivation"" are two important factors that could probably explain what was behind the U.S. quick action towards its close ally Saudi Arabia and the war of Yemen.
The same movements could also be seen recently in the discussions inside the British House of Commons and the House of Lords, which focused on Khashoggi's murder and the war in Yemen.
Professor Ali al-Ammary of the Faculty of Media in Sanaa University argued that the increasing pictures of Yemen's war, particularly the airstrikes, the Yemeni malnourished children and depressed Yemeni families on western media front pages, were the key factor behind the recent international pressure to end the war.
""The peoples in the U.S. and Europe have become aware that millions of Yemeni children are dying from malnutrition, starvation and epidemic diseases as a result from the Saudi-led coalition naval blockade for more than three years,"" said al-Ammary.
It was an ""ignored war"" for many months because many western journalists had been denied access to Yemen, by now the international media organizations have become more active in reporting daily tragedies of millions of Yemenis.
""It has become facts that are shown by international media outlets, newspapers and televisions on a daily basis, and that put pressure on the U.S. and Britain to take an action now to stop this conflict,"" al-Ammary said.
""I think it's the right moment to push for the Yemen peace, which represents all the best opportunity to date,"" he added.","['The United States has been mounting pressure to bring an end to the war in Yemen that is pitting its close allies in the Saudi-led coalition against Iranian-allied Shiite Houthi rebels.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"Powerful quake shakes western Greece, no major injuries","A powerful earthquake shook western Greece early on Friday, damaging a port and a 15th century monastery, but causing no major injuries, officials and local media said.
The quake sent out tremors felt as far afield as Libya, Italy, Malta and Albania.
Greek authorities initially issued a tsunami warning then withdrew the alert.
The magnitude 6.4 quake struck in the Ionian Sea, 50 km (31 miles) south of the island of Zakynthos, also known as Zante, Greece’s Geodynamic Institute reported.
The U.S. Geological Survey rated the magnitude at 6.8.
Three people were taken to hospital on the island, two of them slightly injured, a spokesman for Greece’s civil protection agency said.
A series of aftershocks, the highest at 5.6, rattled the island and power was briefly disrupted.
Tremors damaged a 15th-century monastery on the nearby islands of Strofades, local media in Zakynthos reported.
They also left large cracks in the port of Zakynthos, though authorities there said operations would continue as usual.
“We are not facing any particular problems,” Zakynthos Mayor Pavlos Kolokotsas told Greek state broadcaster ERT.
“Calm is being restored.”
Extensive damage was avoided because quake-prone Zakynthos had adopted seismic protection codes in construction, said Efthymios Lekkas, head of Greece’s Earthquake Planning and Protection Organisation.
“The energy unleashed, based on the angle of the faultline, fanned out towards Italy,” he added.
Italy’s Il Messaggero online news site said the quake was felt hundreds of kilometers away in southern Italy.
Firefighters in Calabria, Puglia and Sicily received thousands of telephone calls from worried locals.
Zakynthos was all but destroyed in a 6.8 tremor in 1953.
More than 140 people were killed in an earthquake north of Athens in 1999.
The quake was fairly shallow, according to the USGS, just 14 km (8.7 miles) below the seabed, which would have amplified shaking.
It struck at 1:54 a.m. (2254 GMT, Thursday).
Greece straddles two tectonic plates and often suffers earthquakes.
The EMSC European quake agency said sea levels had risen slightly, by about 20 cm (7.87 inches), but the increase could be higher locally.
It later tweeted sea level changes were also observed in Italy.","['A powerful earthquake shook western Greece early on Friday, damaging a port and a 15th century monastery, but causing no major injuries, officials and local media said.'

Generate a news article for the following headline.,"Nearly 100,000 residents evacuated before flood peak passes Chongqing","Nearly 100,000 residents were temporarily evacuated as a flood peak passed the city proper of southwest China's Chongqing Municipality on Saturday.
Water levels in the Jialing and Yangtze rivers exceeded the warning levels by 5.92 meters and 3.78 meters, respectively, as flood peaks passed the city, according to the municipal flood control and drought relief headquarters.
Heavy rain in the upper reaches of the Yangtze, Jialing, and Fujiang rivers caused the worst floods since 2012 in the region.
The municipality has coordinated multiple dams, including Three Georges, to discharge flood water, issued warnings, and organized the evacuation of residents to minimize the losses caused by the floods.
The Ministry of Emergency Management has also sent emergency relief supplies to severely flooded areas in Sichuan and Gansu provinces Friday, including 8,000 tents, 8,000 folding beds, and 50,000 coats and quilts.
The ministry also dispatched teams to flood-hit areas including Deyang, Sichuan Province, and Dingxi, Gansu Province, to coordinate the rescue efforts.
Heavy rain has also damaged farm and aquatic products, as well as facilities including vegetable greenhouses and livestock housing, and destructed farmlands and fishponds in Sichuan, according to the provincial agricultural department.
Over 1.87 million people have also been affected by flood in Gansu Province, with 14 dead, 4 missing, and 31,600 residents relocated.
Heavy rainstorms also triggered a landslide Thursday in Nanyu village, Zhouqu County, but no casualties have been reported so far.","[""Nearly 100,000 residents were temporarily evacuated as a flood peak passed the city proper of southwest China's Chongqing Municipality on Saturday.""

Generate a news article for the following headline.,MANAGER HIRES CHRISTIE'S TO APPRAISE DETROIT ART MUSEUM HOLDINGS,"The city of Detroit, which has filed for bankruptcy, has formally hired the international auction house Christie’s to appraise part of the city-owned art collection held by the Detroit Institute of Arts, the auction house said Monday.
A decision about whether to sell the art to satisfy creditors has not been made, city officials have said, although all the city’s assets are being evaluated in light of the situation in Detroit, the largest U.S. city ever to file for bankruptcy.
Christie’s representatives had previously visited the museum in early June and confirmed Monday that the company had been hired to appraise the collection but gave no details about which portion of the collection it would be looking at.
“Christie’s was asked to assist due to our expertise in this area across all fine art categories and eras,” it said in its statement.
It said, “In addition we will also assist and advise on how to realize value for the City while leaving the art in the City’s ownership.”
The office of Detroit emergency manager Kevyn Orr will pay Christie’s $200,000 for the appraisal, which is expected to be completed by mid-October, the Detroit Free Press reported on its website.
Christie’s will appraise only artworks that are clearly owned by the city and that are not bound by donor restrictions that might rule out a possible sale, the newspaper said, citing Orr’s spokesman Bill Nowling.","['The city of Detroit, which has filed for bankruptcy, has formally hired the international auction house Christie’s to appraise part of the city-owned art collection held by the Detroit Institute of Arts, the auction house said Monday.'
