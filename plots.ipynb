       "[\"AMR Corp. shareholders on Tuesday rejected two proposals that would have limited executive compensation at the company, which filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2011. The airline's board of directors had recommended that shareholders vote against both proposals. The first proposal would have capped annual compensation for executives at $5 million and the second would have given shareholders a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation each year. AMR is the parent company of American Airlines Group Inc. Shareholders also voted to approve the company's 2014 stock incentive plan, which provides for grants of restricted stock and stock options to eligible employees. In addition, shareholders approved the reappointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2015. AMR filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2011, citing high fuel prices and stiff competition from rivals such as Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Continental Holdings Inc. The airline emerged from bankruptcy protection in December 2013 after reaching a deal with creditors. Shares of AMR were down 0.7% at $46.89 in recent trading.

       " 'Doha Qatar\\'s decision to quit OPEC has raised questions about the cartel\\'s ability to coordinate oil policy with other producers such as Russia and Saudi Arabia, which are currently locked in a fierce competition for market share. The Gulf state\\'s withdrawal from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Monday is likely to be seen as a snub to Saudi Arabia, its main rival in the Middle East, because it was Riyadh that urged Qatar to remain in OPEC. But analysts say Qatar\\'s departure will have little impact on the group\\'s ability to manage oil markets. \"It\\'s not going to make any difference at all,\" said Bob McNally, president of consultancy Rapidan Energy Group. \"Qatar doesn\\'t participate in production decisions, so it wasn\\'t going to affect anything.\" Qatar, the world\\'s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, produces just 600,000 barrels per day of crude oil, less than 2 percent of OPEC\\'s total output. It joined OPEC in 1961, when it was known as Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms, but became an independent emirate in 1971. It is one of the richest countries in the world, thanks to its huge reserves of natural gas. Qatar\\'s energy minister, Mohammed bin Saleh al -Sada, told reporters in Doha on Monday that his country had decided to withdraw from OPEC because it wanted to focus on its gas production. He said Qatar would continue to cooperate closely with OPEC on oil issues. \"We will maintain our partnership with OPEC,\" he said. \"Our relationship with OPEC is built on many years of mutual trust and respect.\" Analysts said Qatar\\'s departure would have no effect on OPEC\\'s ability to set production targets. \"It won\\'t make any difference at all,\" McNally said. \"It\\'s not like Qatar was part of the decision making process anyway.\" OPEC\\'s current members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and Indonesia.

       " 'China has released a white paper on \"facts and China\\'s position\" on trade friction with the United States, which it said was aimed at clarifying misunderstandings and correcting misperceptions. The white paper, issued by the Ministry of Commerce, criticized the United States for imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum products from China and other countries under the pretext of safeguarding national security. It also accused the United States of abusing its power as the world\\'s largest economy to squeeze out competitors and distort global trade rules. \"The U.S. is using trade remedy measures such as antidumping and countervailing duty investigations and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to curb Chinese exports to the detriment of Chinese exporters,\" the ministry said in the white paper. In March, President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum directing the U.S. Commerce Department to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports. The move drew strong protests from many U.S. allies, including Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Japan and the European Union. On March 22, China announced retaliatory tariffs on 128 U.S. products worth $3 billion, including pork, wine and orange juice, in response to the new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum products. Since then, Washington and Beijing have been locked in a tit for tat over trade issues. According to the white paper, China\\'s exports to the United States amounted to $506.7 billion in 2017, accounting for 18.8 percent of the total U.S. imports, while its imports from the United States totaled $130.9 billion, accounting for 7.9 percent of the total U.S. imports. The trade balance between China and the United States was $375.8 billion in 2017, an increase of 8.7 percent from 2016, according to the ministry. The United States has repeatedly blamed China for unfair trade practices, including dumping, subsidies and intellectual property rights violations, claiming that they have led to massive job losses in the United States. However, the white paper said that these allegations are not supported by evidence. \"China\\'s WTO accession commitments do not contain provisions on export subsidies, and China has never provided export subsidies,\" the ministry said. \"The U.S. has no right to use the WTO dispute settlement mechanism to denounce China\\'s implementation of its WTO accession commitments.\" The ministry also urged the United States to respect the multilateral trading system represented by the World Trade Organization and refrain from unilateralism and protectionism.',\n",

Deutsche Bank declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Germany's federal prosecutor's office said she could not immediately confirm or deny the raids. Prosecutors have been investigating since at least 2015 whether Mossack Fonseca employees violated money laundering laws by setting up front companies for clients, some of whom are suspected of being involved in criminal activities, such as drug trafficking or corruption.

Uber's commission payments to drivers in Argentina rose to $13.2 million in the first quarter from $8.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to documents viewed by Reuters. Uber declined to comment on the figures. The company is locked in a legal battle with Argentina's taxi unions, which have staged protests and filed lawsuits against the company.

Investors have been increasingly vocal in recent weeks about their displeasure with the planned spinoff, which they fear could dilute their stakes in Dell and VMware. The company's $24 billion buyout of EMC Corp last year gave it control of VMware, whose shares are worth more than those of Dell on a standalone basis. A source familiar with the matter said Dell was now considering alternatives to the spinoff, but declined to elaborate. Dell did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Dell and Silver Lake had considered listing VMware on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq before opting for the spinoff earlier this year. Listing VMware as a tracking stock would allow Dell shareholders to track the value of their stake in VMware without having to actually own the stock. Dell and Silver Lake had hoped to list VMware by the end of 2016, but postponed the process after receiving negative feedback from investors. Dell and Silver Lake are now aiming to list VMware in the first half of 2017, one of the sources said. Another source said the companies were unlikely to proceed with the spinoff unless they can get investor approval.

       " 'Thyssenkrupp on Tuesday defended its decision to split into two companies, saying it was the only way to create value for shareholders, after analysts and investors questioned the plan. The German industrial conglomerate, which makes elevators, car parts and submarines, said earlier this month it would spin off its elevator business into a separately listed company by 2020, creating one of the world\\'s largest makers of lifts. But many investors have expressed scepticism over the plan, with shares falling more than 10 percent since the announcement. \"We are convinced that the separation is the right thing to do,\" Chief Financial Officer Martina Merz told reporters at the company\\'s annual general meeting in Essen, western Germany. \"We are convinced that we can create value for our shareholders.\" Analysts have questioned whether Thyssenkrupp can generate enough synergies to justify the costs of splitting up the company. It has set a target of generating 500 million euros in cost savings annually by 2020, but analysts at Commerzbank warned last week that these savings may not be enough to cover the expenses of the split. Thyssenkrupp also faces stiff competition from U.S. rival Otis, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and China\\'s home grown Mitsubishi Electric Corp. Thyssenkrupp said on Tuesday it expects to book an impairment charge of 1.3 billion euros related to the elevator business in its financial results for 2016. The company had previously said it expected an impairment charge of between 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion euros. In addition, Thyssenkrupp said on Tuesday it would buy back up to 10 percent of its shares outstanding for up to 500 million euros.

It was not immediately clear if Lampert's offer would be enough to convince Sears' lenders to waive a requirement that it pay back a $134 million debt due on Tuesday. A representative for Sears did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of Sears closed up 5 percent at $3.78 on Monday. They have fallen more than 60 percent this year.

Zhang said that during Correa\\'s visit, the two sides are expected to sign a series of cooperation agreements in various fields, including economy, trade, investment, agriculture, science and technology, education, culture and sports. According to the ambassador, Ecuador has become one of the biggest trading partners of China in Latin America. \"In 2015, China\\'s trade with Ecuador totaled 4.6 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for more than 10 percent of Ecuador\\'s total trade volume,\" he said. He added that China is also Ecuador\\'s second largest source of imports after the United States, and the country\\'s fourth largest export destination after the United States, Brazil and Colombia. \"China\\'s direct investment in Ecuador has been increasing steadily in recent years,\" the ambassador said. \"By the end of 2015, China\\'s cumulative direct investment in Ecuador reached 3.8 billion U.S. dollars, covering sectors such as telecommunications, mining, oil and gas, infrastructure, manufacturing and tourism,\" he said. Zhang pointed out that China and Ecuador have carried out fruitful cooperation in the fields of infrastructure construction, energy, agriculture, fishery, forestry, environmental protection, public health and poverty alleviation. \"Cooperation between the two countries in these areas has greatly benefited the people of Ecuador,\" he said. In addition, the ambassador said that China and Ecuador are working together to push forward the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative, which was proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013. \"We hope that Ecuador will actively participate in the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road,\" he said.',\n",
       " \", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. It's been a good year for stocks. The S&P 500 index is up more than 10 percent since the start of 2016, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 14 percent. But some investors have done even better than the indexes. Here's a look at how individual investors did in 2016, using data from the American Association of Individual Investors. The chart below shows the performance of the S&P 500 index and the average portfolio of individual investors in 2016. As you can see, the average investor's portfolio beat the S&P 500 by about 1 percentage point. This isn't an unusual pattern. According to AAII data going back to 1987, the average investor has outperformed the S&P 500 index about 60 percent of the time. So why do so many investors underperform the market? There are several reasons. One is that investors tend to buy high and sell low. They also tend to panic during market downturns and sell their stocks when prices are falling. Another reason is that many investors don't diversify their portfolios. Instead, they put all their money in one or two stocks, which is a risky strategy. Finally, many investors don't have a long enough investment horizon. They sell their stocks after a few months or years, instead of holding on for the long term. If you're an individual investor, there are things you can do to improve your chances of outperforming the market. First, diversify your portfolio. Don't put all your money in one or two stocks. Second, don't panic during market downturns. Stick to your investment plan and don't sell your stocks when prices are falling. Third, have a long investment horizon. Don't sell your stocks after a few months or years. If you follow these tips, you'll be more likely to outperform the market in 2017 and beyond.\",\n",

Those gains put the Shanghai Composite at its highest level since April 2015, and the Shenzhen Composite at its highest point since December 2015.

       " 'Indian farmers are waiting with bated breath for the government to announce its new agricultural policies as crop prices have plummeted in the past year, according to industry experts. \"The price of wheat is down by 20 percent and that of pulses by 30 percent compared to last year,\" said Rakesh Kumar Jain, president of the Punjab Agricultural Produce Marketing Cooperative Societies Federation Ltd. \"This is primarily because of the monsoon rains which have been scanty,\" he told Xinhua in a telephone interview from New Delhi. India\\'s monsoon rains, which account for about 70 percent of the country\\'s annual rainfall, are crucial for the production of crops such as rice, wheat, cotton and sugarcane. The monsoon rains usually start around June 1 and end around September 30. This year, the monsoon rains started late and many parts of the country received less than normal rainfall. As a result, there has been a drastic fall in the production of crops such as soybean, corn and cotton. At the same time, there has been an increase in the production of pulses such as lentils and chickpeas. \"The government is going to hold consultations with various stakeholders before it announces the new agricultural policies,\" said Jain. \"The new policies will focus on increasing the income of farmers and improving the quality of seeds and fertilizers used by them,\" he added. According to the United Nations\\' Food and Agriculture Organization, India is the world\\'s second largest producer of wheat after China. It is also the second largest producer of rice after China and the third largest producer of maize after the United States and China. India is also the world\\'s largest producer of pulses.

However, the government has been reluctant to increase the minimum support prices for crops such as wheat and rice. It has also been reluctant to provide loans to farmers at low interest rates. The government has instead been focusing on increasing the income of farmers by providing them with subsidies for buying seeds and fertilizers. In addition, the government has been encouraging farmers to adopt modern farming practices such as using drip irrigation systems and crop insurance schemes. The government has also been encouraging farmers to use genetically modified seeds. Despite these efforts, the income of farmers in India has not increased significantly in the past few years.

The deal would value Heinz at more than $8 billion, making it one of the largest acquisitions of a food company in recent memory. It would also be the latest in a series of deals by Berkshire and 3G, which have taken control of some of the world\\'s best known brands, including Kraft, Burger King and Tim Hortons. If the deal goes through, Berkshire and 3G are expected to buy out K.K.R.\\'s partners, the Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital and the Spanish conglomerate Unilever, which holds a minority stake in Heinz. Terms of the deal could not be learned, but people briefed on the negotiations said that Berkshire and 3G were likely to pay about $7 billion for Heinz, or roughly $70 per share. K.K.R. paid $28 billion for Heinz in 2013, or $72.50 per share. An announcement of the deal could come as early as this week, the people briefed on the negotiations said.

Since then, Heinz shares have traded at a discount to their purchase price, reflecting concerns about the company\\'s profitability. Heinz has struggled to grow sales, particularly in the United States, its most important market. Heinz has been trying to reverse that trend with new products, including ketchup flavored with Sriracha, a spicy Thai chili sauce, and salsa flavored with jalapeños and lime juice.

This was offset by an increase in the cost of food and nonalcoholic beverages, which rose 0.1 percent after falling 0.2 percent in October. On a yearly basis, inflation was 0.7 percent in November, down from 0.9 percent in October. Economists polled by Reuters had expected inflation to come in at 0.4 percent in November.

Orders excluding volatile demand for ships and electric appliances also fell 10.6 percent, missing a median market forecast for a 3.5 percent increase. Investment is seen as one of the key pillars of Abe\\'s plan to revitalise the economy, but business sentiment has been dented by rising protectionism around the globe, including the U.S. election win of Donald Trump, who has pledged to impose hefty import tariffs on goods from Mexico and China. \"Companies may be delaying investment decisions due to uncertainty over trade policies,\" said Junichi Sugawara, chief economist at Mizuho Research Institute. \"Given the current situation, it\\'s difficult to expect a sharp pickup in capital expenditure anytime soon.\" Still, analysts said the data was unlikely to alter the Bank of Japan\\'s view that the economy is recovering moderately. The central bank last month kept its ultra loose monetary policy unchanged, saying the economy was expanding moderately with a brighter outlook for capital expenditure. But it warned that risks to the outlook were tilted to the downside, citing weakness in overseas economies and sluggish wage growth. Capital expenditure accounts for about 40 percent of total private investment in Japan. BOJ Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters after the central bank\\'s Jan. 27 meeting that firms have been delaying investment decisions due to global economic uncertainties. He said the BOJ will continue to monitor developments in capital expenditure closely. \"Capital expenditure is showing some signs of picking up, but it\\'s too early to say whether it will lead to a sustained recovery,\" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. \"We need to see how corporate profits fare in the second half of the fiscal year.\" Private capital expenditure rose 1.9 percent in January from the previous month, the Cabinet Office said, missing a median market forecast for a 2.4 percent increase.

Dominion, which expects to start shipping LNG from its Cove Point terminal in Maryland later this year, said in a statement that it was evaluating the potential impact of the tariff on its business. \"Dominion Energy is continuing to work closely with the U.S. Department of Commerce to resolve the issue,\" the company said. The tariff will apply to all LNG imports, whether they come from the United States or elsewhere, the commerce ministry said in a statement posted on its website. The United States is the world\\'s second largest producer of LNG after Qatar, but most of its production is consumed domestically. Exporting LNG has become a priority for U.S. policymakers who want to reduce the country\\'s reliance on energy imports from countries such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. But China, the world\\'s largest LNG importer, has been reluctant to buy U.S. LNG because of concerns about its price competitiveness compared with other suppliers such as Qatar and Australia. Beijing has already imposed a 25 percent tariff on U.S. sorghum, a type of grain used in animal feed, in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump\\'s plan to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum. The U.S. LNG industry has welcomed Trump\\'s protectionist stance on foreign steel and aluminum, but the tariff on LNG threatens to undermine one of the pillars of his \"America First\" policy.

       " 'Luang Prabang, Laos China\\'s investment in Laos has made significant contributions to the Southeast Asian country\\'s economic and social development, said experts at an international conference held here recently. \"Chinese enterprises in Laos are playing an important role in the country\\'s industrialization and modernization process,\" said Bounchanh Sinthavong, secretary general of the Lao National Chamber of Commerce and Industry. According to Sinthavong, there are currently more than 1,000 Chinese enterprises operating in Laos, with a total investment of about 12 billion U.S. dollars. They have created more than 100,000 jobs for Laotians, accounting for 70 percent of the country\\'s total foreign direct investment. The number of Chinese tourists to Laos has also increased sharply in recent years. Statistics from the Lao Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism showed that the number of Chinese tourists visiting Laos reached 1.4 million in 2016, up 35 percent from 2015. The growth rate is much higher than that of other countries, such as Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. \"Chinese investment has contributed greatly to the development of infrastructure in Laos, which has significantly improved the people\\'s livelihood,\" said Sinthavong. For example, he said, the construction of the Nam Theun 2 Hydropower Project in Laos\\' Xayaburi province has not only created jobs for locals, but also provided clean electricity for local residents. The project is jointly invested by China\\'s State Power Investment Corporation and Laos\\' Electricite du Laos Public Enterprise. Since its completion in 2012, the project has generated over 10 billion kWh of electricity, enough to meet the demand of more than 100,000 households in Laos. Meanwhile, according to the Lao Ministry of Education and Sports, more than 2,000 Laotian students have been sent to China to study every year since 2008. There are currently more than 10,000 Laotian students studying in China. \"Studying in China has enabled Laotian students to learn advanced technologies and management skills, which they can later use to promote the country\\'s economic and social development,\" said Sinthavong.

       " ', I want to receive updates from partner sites and other Turner affiliates. The farmers\\' market has become a ubiquitous fixture in American life. But what does that mean for the environment? According to a study published last week in the journal Environmental Research Letters, it may be bad news. The researchers looked at the carbon footprints of food purchased at farmers\\' markets across the United States. They found that the greenhouse gas emissions associated with buying produce at farmers\\' markets were between 30 percent and 40 percent higher than those associated with buying the same food at supermarkets. The reason is pretty straightforward. Supermarkets are able to purchase food in bulk, which reduces the amount of fuel they need to transport their goods. At farmers\\' markets, on the other hand, individual farmers have to truck their produce long distances to get it to the market. To arrive at their results, the researchers used data collected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\\'s National Agricultural Statistics Service. They calculated the \"carbon footprint\" of each type of food based on how much energy was required to grow it, harvest it, transport it, and process it into the final product. They then compared the carbon footprint of food sold at farmers\\' markets to the carbon footprint of similar food sold at supermarkets. The results weren\\'t pretty. Buying apples at a farmers\\' market, for example, produced about 25 percent more carbon dioxide emissions than buying them at a supermarket. And buying lettuce at a farmers\\' market produced about 40 percent more carbon dioxide emissions than buying it at a grocery store. The researchers did note that buying food at farmers\\' markets wasn\\'t always worse for the environment than buying it at supermarkets. For example, buying potatoes at a farmers\\' market produced about 10 percent less carbon dioxide emissions than buying them at a supermarket. But overall, the researchers concluded that buying food at farmers\\' markets had a larger carbon footprint than buying it at supermarkets. Why? Because farmers\\' markets tend to be smaller than supermarkets, and so require more trips to and from the market. In addition, farmers\\' markets don\\'t have the economies of scale that supermarkets do, which means that they can\\'t afford to buy food in bulk. Finally, because farmers\\' markets tend to be located in wealthier neighborhoods, they also tend to be more expensive than supermarkets. All of these factors combine to make farmers\\' markets less efficient than supermarkets when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. So what does this mean for the future of farmers\\' markets? It\\'s hard to say. On the one hand, the study suggests that farmers\\' markets may not be as environmentally friendly as many people think. On the other hand, the study also suggests that there are ways to reduce the carbon footprint of farmers\\' markets. For example, if farmers\\' markets could find ways to buy food in bulk, they could reduce the number of trips they need to make to and from the market. And if farmers\\' markets could find ways to locate themselves in poorer neighborhoods, they could reduce the cost of living for their customers. Ultimately, the best way to reduce the carbon footprint of farmers\\' markets may be to change the way we think about them. Instead of thinking of farmers\\' markets as places where we go to buy fresh, local produce, we should think of them as places where we go to support our local economy. By doing so, we can help to ensure that farmers\\' markets remain a vital part of our communities for years to come.',\n",

       " 'The Philippine Congress has approved President Rodrigo Duterte\\'s request to extend martial law in the southern island of Mindanao for another 60 days. Lawmakers voted on Wednesday to approve the extension by 235 votes to 35. Martial law was imposed in Mindanao after militants affiliated with the Islamic State group attacked Marawi City on May 23. Since then, more than 400 people have been killed in the fighting, which has displaced more than 350,000 people. Duterte declared martial law in Mindanao and suspended the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus on May 23, saying he needed to protect the country from terrorism and rebellion. He said it would last for 60 days but could be extended for another 60 days if necessary. \"We don\\'t want to prolong martial law,\" Duterte said in a televised address on Tuesday night. \"But we are in a state of emergency and we need to be prepared for any eventuality.\" During his speech, Duterte warned that the Philippines could face a repeat of the 1972 declaration of martial law by his predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos, which led to years of human rights abuses and political persecution. \"I will not declare martial law nationwide,\" Duterte said. \"I will only do it in Mindanao. I will only do it in areas where there is rebellion or terrorism. \"During the Marcos regime, about 3,257 people were killed and 35,000 were detained without charges, according to the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines. Duterte has previously said he does not plan to lift martial law in Mindanao before the end of his term in 2022.',\n",

       " 'The United States is pressing Saudi Arabia to agree to a ceasefire in Yemen as part of an effort to end the civil war there. The Trump administration has been criticized for its lack of involvement in the conflict, which began in March 2015 and has left more than 10,000 people dead. But on Tuesday Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. would support a ceasefire \"within days\" if the Saudis agree to it. \"We are going to be pushing very hard to see if we cannot bring the parties together,\" Tillerson told reporters at a joint news conference in Riyadh with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al Jubeir. Tillerson\\'s comments came after meetings with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz and other top Saudi officials, including Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, the country\\'s de facto ruler. Tillerson said the Saudis were receptive to the idea of a ceasefire, but did not say whether they had agreed to one. Saudi Arabia is leading a coalition against the Iranian backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Houthis took over the capital Sanaa in 2014, prompting Saudi Arabia to intervene militarily in 2015 to restore the government of President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. The U.S. has provided logistical and intelligence support to the Saudi campaign, but has refused to sell weapons directly to the Saudis for use in Yemen. The Obama administration was heavily criticized by human rights groups for its support of the Saudi intervention in Yemen. In recent months, however, the Trump administration has begun to take a more active role in the conflict. Last month, the U.S. military carried out its first airstrikes in Yemen since the start of the civil war. The strikes were aimed at Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which has used Yemen as a base of operations. The U.S. has also increased its diplomatic efforts in Yemen, with Tillerson making his first visit to the country earlier this month. The U.S. is pushing for a ceasefire in Yemen for several reasons, experts say. First, the Trump administration wants to show that it is serious about countering Iran\\'s influence in the Middle East. Second, the U.S. is concerned about the humanitarian situation in Yemen, where millions of people are facing starvation. Finally, the U.S. wants to ensure that the Houthis do not gain control of Yemen\\'s strategic ports, which could allow them to threaten Saudi Arabia\\'s oil exports. The U.S. has a number of levers it can use to pressure the Saudis into agreeing to a ceasefire, experts say. The U.S. provides a significant amount of military equipment to the Saudis, and could cut off that supply if the Saudis do not comply with U.S. demands. The U.S. could also impose sanctions on the Saudis, or even withdraw its support for the Saudi intervention in Yemen altogether. However, it is unlikely that the U.S. will take such drastic measures, experts say. The U.S. has a close relationship with Saudi Arabia, and the Saudis are a key ally in the fight against terrorism. The U.S. is also concerned about the humanitarian situation in Yemen, and does not want to see the Houthis take control of the country. The U.S. is likely to continue to push for a ceasefire in Yemen, but it is unlikely that the Saudis will agree to one anytime soon. The U.S. will likely continue to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudi intervention in Yemen, but it is unlikely that the U.S. will sell weapons directly to the Saudis for use in Yemen.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - The House of Representatives is expected to pass legislation as early as Thursday that would block President Obama\\'s plan to withdraw 5,500 combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of the year. But lawmakers are also preparing to rely on President George W. Bush\\'s veto power to prevent Mr. Obama from carrying out the withdrawal. The White House has said it would veto the measure if it were to reach Mr. Obama\\'s desk in its current form. \"There\\'s no question about it,\" Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington and the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, said in an interview on Wednesday. \"The president will veto it. \" Mr. Smith said he was confident that the House would be able to muster the votes needed to override a veto, which requires a vote of two thirds of both chambers of Congress. He said he believed that the Senate would also have enough votes to sustain a veto. A spokeswoman for Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, declined to comment on whether the Senate would vote to override a veto. In a statement on Tuesday, Representative Buck McKeon, Republican of California and the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, called the administration\\'s decision to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan \"premature\" and said the bill would require Mr. Obama to maintain the current troop levels through Dec. 31. \"We should not be playing politics with the lives of our brave men and women in uniform,\" Mr. McKeon said in the statement. Mr. Obama announced last week that he would reduce the number of American troops in Afghanistan to 9,800 by the end of the year, down from 32,000 at the start of 2014. He said he planned to bring all United States troops home from Afghanistan by the end of 2016. Mr. Obama\\'s announcement came just weeks after the release of a report by the Pentagon inspector general that found that the war in Afghanistan had been plagued by wasteful spending and mismanagement. On Wednesday, the House Armed Services subcommittee on emerging threats and capabilities held a hearing on the report. Members of the panel expressed frustration with the lack of accountability in the military\\'s procurement process. \"I think we\\'ve got to clean up our act,\" said Representative Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona and a retired Air Force colonel who flew F16 fighter jets in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"We need to hold people accountable. \" Ms. McSally said she supported Mr. Obama\\'s plans to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan, but added that she was worried about the security situation in the country. \"I don\\'t think we\\'re going to win this war,\" she said. \"But I think we can keep the Taliban from taking over the country. \"',\n",
       " 'Lebanon\\'s parliamentary elections on Sunday will be a litmus test for the country\\'s fragile political consensus as it struggles to overcome deep sectarian divisions that have plagued it since its civil war in 1975 to 1990. Voters will go to the polls for the first time since 2009 to elect 128 members of parliament. They are choosing from among more than 3,000 candidates, many of whom are independents or affiliated with one of the country\\'s 18 major political parties. The election is seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Tammam Salam\\'s government, which has been in power since 2014. \"It\\'s a very important moment for Lebanon,\" said Sami Nader, director of the Levant Institute for Strategic Studies. \"It\\'s the first time in 10 years that we\\'re going to have a parliamentary election.\" The last parliamentary election in 2009 was marred by accusations of widespread fraud and irregularities. Since then, Lebanon has been ruled by a national unity government made up of the country\\'s main political factions, including the Hezbollah militant group and its allies, the Free Patriotic Movement led by President Michel Aoun, and the Future Movement led by Saad Hariri, whose father Rafik Hariri was assassinated in Beirut in 2005. The new parliament will be tasked with approving a new electoral law and setting the date for the next presidential elections, expected to take place in 2016 or 2017. The presidency has been vacant since May 2014, when President Michel Suleiman\\'s term ended without a successor having been elected. Lebanon\\'s political system is based on sectarian quotas, with seats in parliament allocated to each of the country\\'s 18 recognized sects. Under the current system, Christians hold 64 seats, while Muslims hold 62 seats. The remaining seats are reserved for minority groups such as Druze, Shi\\'ites and Sunni Muslims. The Christian Phalange Party, which was founded by former Lebanese President Bachir Gemayel, is expected to win the most seats, followed by the Free Patriotic Movement, the Future Movement and Hezbollah. The Lebanese Forces, a Christian political party led by Samir Geagea, is also expected to do well in the elections. Geagea was released from prison in 2005 after serving 11 years for his involvement in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. \"Lebanon is at a critical juncture,\" Geagea said in an interview with Reuters. \"We want this election to be a turning point in Lebanon\\'s history.\" Some analysts say the results of the election will indicate whether Lebanon\\'s political elite can put aside their differences and work together to improve the country\\'s economy, which has been hit hard by the Syrian civil war raging on its doorstep. \"I think this election will be a referendum on the status quo,\" said Rami G. Khouri, a senior fellow at the Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Relations at the American University of Beirut. \"If the status quo prevails, I don\\'t think there will be much change in Lebanon\\'s political scene.\" Others argue that the election will not have much impact on the country\\'s politics. \"The outcome of the election doesn\\'t really matter,\" said Lina Khatib, director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House. \"The real decisions are made by the big political players.\" CAIRO Islam and politics collided in Egypt on Wednesday in which dozens of people were killed in clashes between militants and security forces in the northern Sinai peninsula.

       " 'JAKARTA, Indonesia - In this country of 260 million people, there are more Muslims than in any other country in the world. That makes Indonesia\\'s upcoming presidential and legislative elections a bellwether for the rise of political Islam around the globe. President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, is running for reelection against former general Prabowo Subianto, who narrowly lost to Jokowi in 2014. Both men are Muslims, but they have very different visions for the future of their country. Jokowi, a former furniture businessman, has pledged to continue his efforts to fight poverty and corruption. He has also vowed to expand access to health care and education. \"I want to be the president of all Indonesians,\" Jokowi said at a recent campaign rally. Subianto, on the other hand, has promised to return the country to the days when it was led by strongmen such as Suharto, the dictator who ruled from 1965 to 1998. Subianto says he will crack down on drug traffickers and criminals, and that he will revive the military\\'s Kopassus unit, which was disbanded in 2004 after allegations of human rights abuses. \"We need a leader who can bring back our dignity,\" Subianto told supporters at a recent campaign rally. The two men are fighting for the votes of Indonesia\\'s growing number of Muslims. Nearly 90 percent of the country\\'s population is Muslim, according to the Pew Research Center, making Indonesia home to the largest Muslim population in the world. Most Indonesian Muslims practice a moderate form of Islam known as Nahdlatul Ulama, which emphasizes religious tolerance and pluralism. But over the past decade, conservative Islamic groups have become increasingly influential in Indonesian politics. These groups, which include the Islamic Defenders Front and Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia, advocate for stricter enforcement of Islamic law and oppose Western cultural influences. Some of these groups have been linked to acts of violence, including the 2002 Bali bombings, in which more than 200 people were killed in attacks on nightclubs frequented by foreign tourists. Jokowi has tried to appeal to conservative Muslim voters without alienating minority groups. During his first term, he introduced a series of regulations restricting the sale of alcohol and gambling. He also appointed clerics to key government posts, including the Ministry of Religious Affairs. Subianto, on the other hand, has courted the support of hardline Islamic groups. He has pledged to make Indonesia a \"modern caliphate\" and to ban alcohol and gambling nationwide. He has also called for the introduction of Islamic law, or sharia, in certain areas of the country. \"Indonesia is an Islamic country,\" Subianto told supporters at a recent campaign rally. \"It is not a Christian country or a Buddhist country. It is an Islamic country.\" The outcome of the election will have implications beyond Indonesia\\'s borders. If Subianto wins, it could embolden Islamic extremists in other countries, including Malaysia and the Philippines. On the other hand, a victory for Jokowi would send a message that Indonesia is committed to religious tolerance and pluralism. As the world\\'s most populous Muslim country, Indonesia has a responsibility to set an example for other Muslim nations. By electing a moderate leader like Jokowi, Indonesia can help to counter the rise of political Islam around the globe. Copyright © 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

General Prayuth Chanocha, who led a coup in 2014 and has been prime minister ever since, told reporters that he had not yet decided whether he would stand for office. \"I haven\\'t made up my mind,\" he said. \"I have to see how things are going.\" He added that he would be prepared to serve as an MP or senator, depending on the wishes of the electorate. \"If the people want me to be an MP, I will be an MP,\" he said. \"If they want me to be a senator, I will be a senator.\" The junta, formally known as the National Council for Peace and Order, has promised to hold elections in 2017, more than three years after it seized power from Yingluck Shinawatra, a sister of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, in a bid to end political instability in the country. However, the junta has repeatedly delayed the polls, citing a lack of progress in drafting a new constitution, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The latest delay came last week when the junta announced that the vote would be postponed until at least February 2018. Prayuth said on Wednesday that he was confident that the constitution would be ready by the end of this year. \"I think it will be done by the end of this year,\" he said. \"If it\\'s not done, it will be done early next year.\" Prayuth said he did not want to be seen as interfering in the process of drafting the new charter. \"I don\\'t want to meddle in the constitutional drafting process,\" he said. \"It\\'s not good for me to do that.\" The junta has come under fire from critics who accuse it of stifling freedom of speech and imposing censorship on the media.

       " 'The country\\'s longest serving leader, Najib Razak, is facing an unprecedented challenge from a former prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, who is 92 years old and has spent much of the last three decades in retirement. It is a contest that will test Malaysia\\'s democratic credentials at a crucial time for the Southeast Asian nation as it seeks to reassert itself on the world stage. Mahathir, who served as prime minister for 22 years between 1981 and 2003, announced his intention to run for the leadership of the United Malays National Organisation, the largest party in the governing Barisan Nasional coalition, at the weekend. He immediately received the backing of the main opposition party, the People\\'s Justice Party, or PKR, led by Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, the wife of imprisoned opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. Mahathir said he was motivated by a desire to save the country from corruption and cronyism under Najib, who has been accused of misappropriating $700m from the state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. \"I can\\'t bear to see the country being destroyed,\" Mahathir told reporters on Monday. \"I don\\'t want my grandchildren to be cursing me for not having done anything when I had the chance to do something about it. \" Najib, who has been prime minister since 2009, has denied all allegations of wrongdoing and has rejected calls to resign. On Monday, Najib said he would welcome a debate with Mahathir. \"I am ready to have a dialogue with Tun Mahathir if he is sincere and wants to work for the betterment of the country,\" Najib said, using Mahathir\\'s honorific title. \"If he really wants to help the rakyat, or people, then let us sit down and discuss how we can move the country forward. \" The next general election is due by August 2018, but could be brought forward if Najib loses the support of his coalition partners. Najib\\'s popularity has plummeted in the wake of the 1MDB scandal, which has also drawn the attention of the US Department of Justice. In recent months, Najib\\'s approval ratings have dipped below 50% for the first time since he became prime minister, according to the Merdeka Center, a polling agency. Last week, Najib fired his deputy, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, after the latter publicly questioned the government\\'s handling of the 1MDB affair. Najib\\'s decision to fire Zahid, who is also the home affairs minister, sent shockwaves through Malaysia\\'s political establishment. \"This is unprecedented,\" said James Chin, director of the Asia Institute at Australia\\'s University of Tasmania. \"Najib has never fired a deputy prime minister before. \" Chin said Mahathir\\'s decision to run for the leadership of UMNO was a \"political masterstroke\" because it would likely split the ruling coalition and force Najib to call an election earlier than planned. \"It\\'s a very clever move,\" Chin said. \"He\\'s probably the only person who can take on Najib. \" Both men are known for their fiery rhetoric. In 1987, Mahathir infamously declared: \"Chinese must go back to China. \" He later apologised for the remark, saying it had been taken out of context. In 2014, Najib described Mahathir as a \"fool\" for criticising him over the 1MDB scandal.',\n",

Conte, a little known law professor, was picked by Mattarella last month to lead a government made up of the 5Star Movement and the League after former Premier Paolo Gentiloni failed to win parliamentary support for his minority government. In his inaugural speech, Conte pledged to be a \"government of change\" that would tackle issues such as youth unemployment, public debt and corruption. \"I want to be a prime minister who is close to the people,\" said Conte. \"I want to be a prime minister who listens to the people, who speaks to the people, who understands the problems of the people and who fights for the people.\" He also vowed to work closely with the European Union, adding that Italy would continue to play a key role within the bloc. \"Italy has always been a cornerstone of the European Union,\" he said. \"It will continue to be so.\" The new government is set to take over on Saturday. It will be the first time since 1946 that Italy has had a government that includes both the 5Star Movement and the League, which have been bitter rivals for decades. The two parties agreed to form a coalition earlier this month after months of negotiations. The deal marks a major shift in Italy\\'s political landscape, which has traditionally been dominated by the center left and center right.

       " 'German Chancellor Angela Merkel\\'s government has hardened its stance on asylum policy, a move that analysts say is aimed at appeasing voters who have shifted sharply to the right in the wake of last year\\'s refugee influx. Merkel\\'s Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, unveiled proposals on Wednesday to tighten asylum laws, which are likely to be enacted by the end of the year. The plan would require asylum seekers to register with the authorities within seven days of arriving in Germany instead of the current 14 days. It would also limit the number of rejected asylum seekers who can appeal their cases to 30 percent from 50 percent. In addition, the government wants to introduce fines of up to 25,000 euros for people who enter the country illegally or help others to do so. \"The government is trying to show that it is tackling the problem of illegal migration,\" said Carsten Koschmieder, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin. \"They want to show that they are doing something against illegal immigration.\" More than a million migrants arrived in Germany last year, many of them fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. The influx was welcomed by Merkel, who said Germans had a moral duty to help those in need. But opinion polls show that attitudes have hardened since then. A survey by pollster Emnid published on Monday showed that 69 percent of Germans believe there are too many migrants in the country. That is up from 58 percent in September and 47 percent in January.

       " 'Iraq\\'s Prime Minister Haider al Abadi announced on Wednesday that Sunni and Shiite leaders had agreed to a series of steps aimed at reconciling the country\\'s rival sects. Mr. Abadi made the announcement at a news conference in Baghdad, where he was joined by the speaker of Parliament, Salim Jabouri, and the top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani. \"Today, we are witnessing a historic day in Iraq,\" Mr. Abadi said. \"The government has succeeded in uniting the political blocs and factions, and we have also succeeded in achieving an agreement between the parliamentary blocs and the popular mobilization forces. \" Mr. Abadi described the agreement as a \"national salvation pact\" that would lead to the formation of a new government within 30 days. He said it would be led by a technocratic prime minister who would be selected by Parliament and approved by Mr. Sistani. The current prime minister, Mr. Abadi, is a member of the Dawa Party, which is part of the Shiite political coalition. Mr. Sistani is the spiritual leader of Iraq\\'s majority Shiite community. Mr. Sistani issued a fatwa, or religious edict, last week calling on Iraqis to unite against the militants of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Mr. Sistani\\'s endorsement of Mr. Abadi\\'s government has been crucial to its survival. On Wednesday, Mr. Sistani reaffirmed his support for Mr. Abadi\\'s government and called on all Iraqis to work together to defeat the militants. Mr. Sistani also called on lawmakers to put aside their differences and elect a new prime minister who would be acceptable to all Iraqis. Mr. Jabouri, the speaker of Parliament, echoed Mr. Sistani\\'s call for national unity. \"We are here today to announce the start of a new phase in the history of Iraq,\" Mr. Jabouri said. \"This phase will be based on the principle of national unity and cooperation. \" Mr. Jabouri did not elaborate on the details of the agreement, but he said it would lead to the formation of a new government within 30 days. Mr. Abadi said the agreement would also lead to the formation of a new security force composed of Sunni and Shiite fighters, as well as Kurdish peshmerga forces. The new security force would be responsible for fighting the militants of the Islamic State. Mr. Abadi also said that the agreement would lead to the release of prisoners held by both the Iraqi government and the militants of the Islamic State. Mr. Abadi did not say how many prisoners would be released, but he said the number would be \"significant. \" The announcement of the agreement came after months of political infighting in Iraq. In recent weeks, Mr. Abadi has faced mounting pressure from both Sunni and Shiite leaders to form a new government. Mr. Abadi\\'s predecessor, Nuri Kamal al Maliki, was widely criticized for excluding Sunni leaders from the government and for failing to crack down on corruption. Mr. Maliki\\'s refusal to step down led to the rise of the militants of the Islamic State, who took over large swaths of territory in northern and western Iraq last year. Mr. Abadi has vowed to fight the militants of the Islamic State, but he has struggled to win the support of Sunni leaders. Some Sunni leaders have accused Mr. Abadi of being too close to Mr. Maliki, while others have accused him of being too soft on the militants of the Islamic State. The agreement announced on Wednesday appears to be a compromise between the two sides. It calls for the formation of a new government within 30 days, but it also gives Mr. Abadi the power to appoint a new prime minister if he feels that the current prime minister is not doing enough to fight the militants of the Islamic State. The agreement also calls for the release of prisoners held by both the Iraqi government and the militants of the Islamic State. Mr. Abadi did not say how many prisoners would be released, but he said the number would be \"significant. \" The announcement of the agreement came after months of political infighting in Iraq.

       " 'A Japanese high court on Thursday rejected demands from residents of Okinawa to halt the planned relocation of a U.S. Marine Corps base within the southern island prefecture, paving the way for the government to move ahead with the unpopular project. The ruling by the Naha District Court means the central government can proceed with its plan to relocate the U.S. Marine Corps Futenma Air Station to a coastal area in the town of Henoko, which is home to endangered coral reefs and dugong marine mammals. Residents had sought a court injunction to block the construction of a new base there, arguing that it would cause irreversible damage to the local ecosystem. \"We\\'re extremely disappointed,\" said Tsuyoshi Yasumoto, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs. \"We\\'re going to appeal to the Supreme Court.\" Lawyers for the plaintiffs said they would file an appeal with Japan\\'s Supreme Court within 10 days. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\\'s government has been seeking to relocate the Futenma base since 1996, but has faced stiff opposition from Okinawa residents, who say the facility poses a security threat to the prefecture as well as noise pollution and accidents involving U.S. military aircraft. More than half of all U.S. military personnel in Japan are stationed in Okinawa, despite the island accounting for just 0.6 percent of Japan\\'s total land area. In 2015, a U.S. Marine Corps helicopter crashed into a residential area near the Futenma base, killing four people on the ground and injuring six others. The incident sparked massive protests against the U.S. military presence in Okinawa, including a demonstration in which more than 100,000 people marched through the streets of Tokyo calling for the removal of all U.S. military bases from the country. About 80 percent of Okinawans oppose the relocation of the Futenma base to Henoko, according to opinion polls.',\n",
       " 'French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron\\'s campaign manager on Sunday urged Europeans to vote for the pro European Union establishment in next week\\'s elections, in a challenge to the populist and eurosceptic wave that has swept the bloc in recent years. \"We are at a crossroads in Europe,\" said Jean Rottner, who is also mayor of the city of Strasbourg in eastern France. \"If we want to save the European Union, if we want it to live up to our expectations, if we want it to be strong and credible, then we must vote for those who defend it,\" he told Reuters in an interview. Macron, a former economy minister, is widely seen as the frontrunner in the May 23 ballot to succeed Francois Hollande as French president. He has positioned himself as a defender of the European Union, which he says is under threat from nationalists such as Britain\\'s Nigel Farage and Italy\\'s Matteo Salvini. But Rottner, a member of the Socialist Party, warned that voters risked handing victory to far right and Eurosceptic parties if they did not turn out to vote. \"It would be a catastrophe for Europe,\" he said. A poll published on Sunday showed Macron\\'s centrist En Marche! party was set to win 25 percent of the vote, with Marine Le Pen\\'s far right National Front second on 21 percent. The surge in support for the National Front and other populist parties across the bloc since the 2008 financial crisis has prompted soul searching among mainstream politicians over their failure to connect with voters. Rottner acknowledged that many people were disillusioned with the political establishment, but he said this was no reason to give up on the European Union. \"Today there is a lot of mistrust, a lot of disappointment,\" he said. \"But I believe in the European Union. I believe in its values. I believe in its ability to change things. \" Voter turnout could be crucial in determining the outcome of the election, which will see 751 members of the European Parliament chosen by voters in each of the 28 EU member states. Turnout in the last election in 2014 was just 42.6 percent, the lowest since the first directly elected parliament was created in 1979. Rottner said he was confident that turnout would be higher this time around. \"I don\\'t think it will be very high, but I think it will be higher than in 2014,\" he said.

The vote was 85 to 13, with just two Republicans joining Democrats in supporting the amendment. It was sponsored by Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, who said it was intended to make clear to the Iraqi government that the United States would not stay there indefinitely. \"Iraq\\'s leaders need to know that if they fail to meet their end of the bargain, the United States will leave,\" Mr. Udall said. The amendment would require the secretary of defense to submit a plan to Congress within 90 days of enactment of the legislation, which is expected to happen next week, outlining a schedule for withdrawing all American forces from Iraq by Dec. 31,2011. The Obama administration opposes the amendment because it says it would send the wrong signal to Iraq\\'s leaders and could undermine efforts to negotiate a new status of forces agreement between the United States and Iraq. That agreement, which took effect in January, calls for American troops to withdraw from Iraq by the end of 2011. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has said he believes that the United States should have no more than 40,000 troops in Iraq by the end of 2011, or about 10,000 fewer than are there now. The House version of the defense policy bill does not include the amendment.

Turkish officials say they have audio and video recordings that prove Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Saudi Arabia says Khashoggi died accidentally in a fistfight inside the consulate. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will travel to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to meet with King Salman and other senior Saudi officials, the State Department said Monday.

The Fawcett Society\\'s report also highlighted the dearth of women in the House of Lords, where only 21% of peers are women. There are currently 792 members of the House of Lords, of whom 163 are women. This means that there are 629 men in the House of Lords compared with 429 women. The proportion of women in the House of Lords has risen steadily since 1999, when it stood at 13%. But the rate of progress has slowed in recent years, prompting the Fawcett Society to call on the government to introduce legislation to increase the number of women in the House of Lords. \"Women remain underrepresented in the House of Lords, which undermines our democracy,\" Smethers said. \"The government must take urgent action to increase the representation of women in the House of Lords. \"',\n",

       " 'German Chancellor Angela Merkel\\'s conservative bloc on Sunday overwhelmingly backed her bid to lead the party into national elections in September 2017. Merkel, who has led the Christian Democratic Union since 2000, won nearly 85 percent of the votes cast by delegates at the party\\'s congress in Essen, western Germany. \"I am delighted with this result,\" Merkel told the congress. \"I am very grateful for your confidence.\" The chancellor is widely expected to win a fourth term in office when Germans go to the polls next year. She has led Europe\\'s largest economy for more than a decade and has emerged as the continent\\'s most popular politician. Merkel\\'s conservatives are currently in coalition with the center left Social Democrats, but she has ruled out another grand coalition with the SPD after last month\\'s state election defeat in Mecklenburg Western Pomerania. A new government will likely be formed between Merkel\\'s CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union CSU, and the Greens and the Free Democrats FDP. Merkel faces a tough fight against the far right Alternative for Germany AfD, which has surged in the polls since it was founded in 2013 and now threatens to enter the Bundestag for the first time. Merkel\\'s main rivals for the CDU leadership post are Health Minister Hermann Groehe, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere and former Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel. De Maiziere said he would not challenge Merkel for the party leadership. \"I have decided not to run for the CDU chairmanship,\" de Maiziere said in a statement. \"I want to focus fully on my work as interior minister.\" Merkel, 61, has said she will step down from the chancellorship in 2021, when she will be 67.

       " 'Washington The 2016 Democratic presidential field is increasingly embracing gun control as an issue, even as polls show it\\'s unpopular with much of the electorate. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the two frontrunners for their party\\'s nomination, have both made gun control a central part of their campaigns in recent weeks. On Friday, Martin O\\'Malley, the former Maryland governor who is struggling to make an impact in the race, became the first candidate to call for a ban on military style assault weapons. \"I am calling for a national ban on military style assault weapons,\" O\\'Malley said in a statement. \"There is no reason why any civilian needs an assault weapon. \" It\\'s a bold move for O\\'Malley, who has struggled to find his footing in the crowded field. But it may also be a smart one. A new Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday found that just 37% of Americans support a ban on military style assault weapons, while 58% oppose such a ban. That\\'s down from 45% support in 2013, according to Quinnipiac. But Democrats are far more likely to support such a ban than Republicans. Among Democrats, 79% support a ban on military style assault weapons, while just 15% oppose it. Among Republicans, just 25% support a ban, while 68% oppose it. And among independents, 50% support a ban, while 42% oppose it. Clinton and Sanders have both called for a renewal of the assault weapons ban that was passed in 1994 and expired in 2004. Clinton has gone further, saying she would push for a ban on high capacity ammunition magazines, which were banned under the 1994 assault weapons ban but allowed again by the Supreme Court in 2008. Sanders has not called for a ban on high capacity ammunition magazines, though he has said he supports a ban on military style assault weapons. O\\'Malley\\'s call for a ban on military style assault weapons came just days after the mass shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, where a gunman killed three people and injured nine others. The shooter, Robert L. Dear, used a AR 15 rifle, a semiautomatic rifle similar to those banned under the 1994 assault weapons ban. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Clinton and Sanders both called for a renewal of the assault weapons ban. Clinton went a step further, saying she would push for a ban on high capacity ammunition magazines, which were banned under the 1994 assault weapons ban but allowed again by the Supreme Court in 2008. Sanders has not called for a ban on high capacity ammunition magazines, though he has said he supports a ban on military style assault weapons. Both Clinton and Sanders have faced criticism from gun control advocates for not going far enough on the issue. After the Planned Parenthood shooting, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence put out a scathing statement criticizing Clinton and Sanders for not calling for a ban on high capacity ammunition magazines. \"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders say they support a ban on assault weapons, but they won\\'t go far enough,\" Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign, said in a statement. \"If they want to be serious about preventing gun violence, they should support a ban on high capacity ammunition magazines, which can fire up to 100 rounds without having to reload.\" The National Rifle Association, meanwhile, has attacked Clinton and Sanders over their calls for a renewal of the assault weapons ban. \"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders continue to pander to their anti gun supporters by promising to reinstate the so called \\'assault weapons ban,\\'\" Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA\\'s Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement. \"This is nothing more than a political stunt designed to curry favor with radical gun control activists.\" While Clinton and Sanders have embraced gun control as an issue, other Democratic candidates have been more cautious.

       " \"Swedish voters are heading to the polls on Sunday to cast their ballots in the country's general elections. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven's Social Democrats are expected to emerge as the biggest party, but they will likely fall short of a majority in parliament. The election comes at a time when Sweden has been rocked by a series of terrorist attacks and sexual assaults committed by refugees and migrants. In April, a police officer was shot and killed by an asylum seeker from Uzbekistan who had been denied residency in the country. In August, a truck was driven into a crowd of people in Stockholm, killing five and injuring dozens more. And in December, a Somali refugee stabbed a woman to death and wounded four others in a mall in Västerås, about 100 kilometers west of Stockholm. The attacks have fueled a backlash against Sweden's liberal immigration policy, which has allowed hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers to enter the country since 2015. Polls show that support for the Sweden Democrats, a rightwing populist party, has surged in recent months. The party, which advocates tougher immigration policies, is expected to win between 20 and 23 percent of the vote, making it the second largest party after the Social Democrats. While the Sweden Democrats are not expected to win enough seats in parliament to form a government, they are likely to play a decisive role in any coalition negotiations. The outcome of the election will be closely watched by other European countries, including Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union is facing a tough challenge from the rightwing Alternative for Germany party.\",\n",

Over the past few years, China has intensified its efforts to crack down on organized crime groups, as well as corrupt officials who collude with criminals. In September 2015, the Communist Party of China Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate jointly issued a guideline on combating corruption and organized crime, which called for a tougher stance against corrupt officials who collude with criminals. According to the guideline, judicial organs should severely punish corrupt officials who collude with criminals, and those who take bribes or abuse their power to help criminals commit crimes. Since the guideline was issued, more than 6,000 corrupt officials have been investigated for colluding with criminals, and more than 3,000 of them have been punished, according to the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate.',\n",
       " 'Sweden\\'s Social Democrats will seek to form a minority government with the support of other parties after gaining the most votes in Sunday\\'s election but failing to win an overall majority, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said on Monday. The center left party won 30.7 percent of the vote, down from 31.2 percent in the 2014 election and its worst result since 1896, according to preliminary results. \"We are going to try to form a minority government,\" Lofven told a news conference, adding that he had already spoken to representatives of the Green Party, the Left Party and the Christian Democrats. He did not give a time frame for the formation of a new government. A spokeswoman for the Greens said they were prepared to talk to the Social Democrats about forming a minority government. The Left Party said it was ready to discuss a coalition with the Social Democrats, while the Christian Democrats declined to comment. The Social Democrats would need to form a coalition with at least one other party to govern, although they may be able to form a minority government with the support of the Greens, the Left Party and the Liberals. The Liberal Party came in second with 14.3 percent of the vote, up from 10.5 percent in 2014. The anti immigration Sweden Democrats came in third with 13.1 percent of the vote, making them the country\\'s second largest party. The Sweden Democrats campaigned on an anti immigration agenda and have often been accused of harboring neo Nazi sympathies. The party denies any links to racism. The Social Democrats lost around 5 percentage points compared to the 2014 election, when they won 31.2 percent of the vote and formed a minority government with the help of the Greens and the Left Party. On Monday, the Social Democrats ruled out forming a coalition with the Sweden Democrats. \"The Sweden Democrats do not belong in a government,\" Lofven told reporters. The Social Democrats also ruled out forming a coalition with the Liberals or the Moderates, which came in fourth with 12.9 percent of the vote. The conservative Moderate Party, led by former Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, saw its support drop sharply from 23.2 percent in 2014 to 12.9 percent on Sunday.

       " 'WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling for an end to U.S. military support for the Saudi Arabia coalition in Yemen\\'s civil war and blaming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. The vote was 63 to 37, with 14 Republicans joining all Democrats in backing the measure. Republican Senator Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced the resolution along with Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, the committee\\'s top Democrat. The House of Representatives is expected to take up a similar resolution next week. \"The United States must not be complicit in Saudi Arabia\\'s human rights violations,\" Corker said on the floor of the Senate before the vote. \"I hope that this vote sends a message to the Saudis that we are not going to turn a blind eye to their reckless behavior.\" The resolution says the United States should stop refueling Saudi aircraft engaged in military operations in Yemen. It also condemns Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed for his role in the murder of Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 and calls on him to be sanctioned under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. The Trump administration has vowed to hold those responsible for Khashoggi\\'s death accountable, but has stopped short of pinning blame on the Saudi crown prince. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday it was \"premature\" to make judgments about who was responsible for Khashoggi\\'s killing. \"We\\'re going to find out what happened.

Opening statements are scheduled Monday in the trial of Drew Peterson, who was charged with killing his third wife, Kathleen Savio, in March 2004. Prosecutors allege he killed her by drowning her in a bathtub. Ms. Savio\\'s death was initially ruled an accident, but after Mr. Peterson\\'s fourth wife, Stacy, disappeared in 2007, authorities reopened the investigation and found evidence that she had been strangled. Mr. Peterson has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him. If convicted, he could face life in prison. Mr. Peterson was a police sergeant in the town of Bolingbrook at the time of his wife\\'s death. He resigned in 2009. His attorney, Joel Brodsky, said last month that Mr. Peterson was \"ready to take on\" the case. \"He\\'s looking forward to having his day in court,\" Mr. Brodsky said.

       " 'A unit of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility on Monday for a series of suicide bombings that killed at least 25 people in Algiers, the deadliest attack in the Algerian capital in years. The group said in a statement posted online that it had carried out the attacks to avenge the death of Abdelmalek Droukdel, the group\\'s leader, who was killed last month in a raid by French special forces in Mali. The attacks, which included two suicide bombings and a gun battle, came just days after Algeria\\'s president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, announced his intention to run for a fifth term in office in next year\\'s elections. It was not immediately clear whether the attacks were linked to Mr. Bouteflika\\'s reelection bid. In addition to the 25 people killed, more than 100 others were injured in the attacks, according to the Algerian authorities. The first attack took place around 11 a.m. when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives belt outside a police station in the town of Boumerdes, about 30 miles east of Algiers. Shortly afterward, another suicide bomber detonated an explosives belt at a military barracks in the same town, according to the Algerian Interior Ministry. Around the same time, a third suicide bomber detonated an explosives belt at a police station in the town of Sour El Ghozlane, about 40 miles east of Algiers, according to the Interior Ministry. The interior minister, Noureddine Bedoui, told reporters at the scene of one of the attacks that the three suicide bombers were \"young men\" and that they appeared to have acted alone. He declined to give further details about the attackers, citing an ongoing investigation. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, but they bore the hallmarks of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which has been waging an insurgency against the Algerian government since 2007. The group, which is also known as A. Q. M. or A. Q. I. M. , has carried out dozens of attacks in Algeria, including suicide bombings, assassinations and kidnappings. Mr. Droukdel was killed in a raid by French special forces in Mali on May 26. A. Q. M. said in its statement that it had carried out the attacks in retaliation for Mr. Droukdel\\'s death.

Mr. Quattrocchi was killed in a 2003 ambush by Islamic militants in Iraq. He had been taken hostage in Libya along with Ms. Sgrena, a reporter for the Communist newspaper Il Manifesto, and three other Italians. In 2007, she was freed in a prisoner swap, but Mr. Quattrocchi was killed during the exchange.

He was sentenced to death in 2004. Swearingen\\'s lawyers had argued he was innocent, pointing to DNA evidence that they said excluded him as the killer. But prosecutors maintained Swearingen killed Trotter in retaliation for her rejection of his advances. Swearingen was pronounced dead at 6:43 p.m. CDT, 15 minutes after receiving a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Robert Hurst said. Swearingen did not make a final statement before his execution, Hurst said. Swearingen\\'s attorney, James Rytting, told reporters after the execution that Swearingen had maintained his innocence until the very end. \"Larry has always maintained his innocence,\" Rytting said. \"He still maintains his innocence.\" Swearingen\\'s family members declined to comment after the execution, Hurst said. Swearingen\\'s case became a cause celebre for supporters who believed he was wrongly convicted. They pointed to the DNA evidence, which showed no connection between Swearingen and Trotter. Prosecutors argued that Swearingen killed Trotter because she had rejected his romantic advances. Trotter\\'s body was found on Dec. 8,2002, in the trunk of her car, which was parked at the edge of Sam Houston Park, a popular spot for lovers. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled, according to court records. Swearingen was arrested in January 2003 and indicted in April 2003. His trial began in May 2004. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence that Swearingen had threatened Trotter with a knife during an argument at a bar earlier that year. Swearingen\\'s defense attorneys argued that someone else killed Trotter and that Swearingen was framed by investigators. Swearingen was convicted and sentenced to death in September 2004. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Swearingen\\'s conviction. Swearingen filed several unsuccessful appeals challenging his conviction and sentence. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied his most recent appeal in June. Swearingen is the ninth person executed this year in Texas, which carries out capital punishment more than any other state.

There are now more than 5,000 U.S. military personnel in Iraq as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, which is aimed at defeating the Islamic State group. This week, President Barack Obama announced that he would send another 560 troops to Iraq to train and advise Iraqi forces fighting the Islamic State. Here\\'s a look back at the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. On March 19,2003, the U.S. launched Operation Iraqi Freedom, which led to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein\\'s government. The invasion was carried out by a coalition of countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Poland, Spain, and other NATO allies.

Four policemen were killed and 13 others were wounded in the Dec. 24 attack in Sheikh Zuweid, which is near the border with the Gaza Strip. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it targeted a \"security checkpoint. \" In response to the attack, Egypt launched a wide crackdown on militants in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula, which borders Israel and the Gaza Strip. Security forces conducted dozens of raids across the area, killing at least 70 suspected militants and arresting more than 100 others, according to the Interior Ministry. Authorities imposed a nighttime curfew in some parts of the peninsula and deployed tanks and armored personnel carriers to the area.

It was the latest in a string of killings that have plagued the region for decades. The shooter was detained and sentenced to five years in prison. But he has not yet been handed over to serve his sentence. \"We don\\'t know when we will get him back,\" said Abdel Rahman Ahmed, a local police official. \"We are waiting for instructions from the prosecutor.\" His case is just one of hundreds of unresolved cases in the region, which authorities say could take years to resolve. Ahmad Mohamed, a senior security official in the city of Aswan, told Xinhua on Thursday that there were more than 300 unresolved cases of blood feuds in the governorate. He added that the number of unresolved cases had decreased in recent years as the government stepped up efforts to curb the practice. Blood feuds are a form of vendetta in which members of rival clans kill or injure each other in order to avenge the death of a family member. The practice is common in rural areas of Egypt, particularly in the southern provinces of Aswan, Luxor and Qena. In recent years, the government has launched a campaign to eradicate the practice. In 2014, President Abdel Fattah launched a national initiative aimed at ending blood feuds. The initiative includes a number of measures, such as providing financial support to families affected by blood feuds and establishing reconciliation committees to help resolve disputes. Despite these efforts, blood feuds continue to be a major problem in southern Egypt. According to a report by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, a human rights organization, there were more than 1,000 unresolved cases of blood feuds in Aswan alone in 2016. The report also found that the majority of victims of blood feuds were young men between the ages of 20 and 30. Many of them were killed in public places, such as markets and bus stations. The report also found that the majority of perpetrators of blood feuds were young men between the ages of 20 and 30. Many of them were members of rival clans. The report called on the Egyptian government to take urgent action to end the practice of blood feuds. \"The practice of blood feuds is a serious violation of human rights and must be stopped immediately,\" the report said. \"The Egyptian government must take urgent action to end the practice of blood feuds and ensure that those responsible for these crimes are brought to justice.\"',\n",

Smith, 54, was convicted in 2003 of raping a woman in Palm Beach, Florida, in 1991. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison but was released on bail in 2004 while he appealed his conviction. The ruling by the Massachusetts Appeals Court said the jury should have been instructed that it could find Smith not guilty if it found the woman had consented to having sex with him. \"Because the jury was not so instructed, we reverse the conviction and remand the case for a new trial,\" the three judges wrote in their decision. Smith\\'s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Smith was accused of raping a woman at a house party in Palm Beach, Florida, in 1991. He testified that he had consensual sex with the woman, who told police she had been drinking heavily before the alleged attack. Smith is the grandson of Joseph P. Kennedy, an older brother of President John F. Kennedy. His father, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a prominent environmental lawyer and activist. In 1994, Smith lost a defamation lawsuit against British journalist Dominick Dunne, author of the book \"The Way We Lived Then: Recollections of a Well Known Name Dropper.\" Dunne wrote that Smith raped the woman. Smith sued Dunne for libel after the book was published, and a jury awarded him $750,000 in damages. But the verdict was overturned on appeal because the jury had been improperly instructed on the definition of libel.

The attack happened in the early hours of Tuesday morning in Mocimboa da Praia, a town in the province that borders Tanzania, according to a statement from the Mozambican Council of Churches. \"At least seven people were killed and several others injured,\" the statement said. The council said it was not clear who carried out the attack, although it is suspected to have been linked to Islamist militant group Ahlu Sunnah Wa Jamaah. The group has been blamed for a series of attacks in the region since October 2017. It is believed to be led by Sheikh Abubakar Awaisi, an Islamic preacher from Tanzania who fled to Mozambique in 2015 after being accused of inciting violence in his home country. The group\\'s name means \"Followers of the Prophet Muhammad\\'s Teachings\" in Arabic. In April, Mozambique\\'s President Filipe Nyusi described the attacks as \"an attempt to destabilize the country\" and called on the international community to support efforts to fight terrorism.

Some 2,200 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and 73 Israelis, most of them soldiers, were killed in the ensuing fighting. Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip after Hamas seized control of the coastal enclave in 2007 from forces loyal to Western donor Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority. Israel says its blockade is necessary to prevent Hamas arming itself with rockets and other weaponry. Hamas denies the charge.

The center is operated by the Texas Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services. \"These are very serious allegations and we take them very seriously,\" said Patrick Crimmins, a spokesman for the agency. \"D.F.P.S. will continue to work closely with the S.W.T.C. to ensure that all allegations of abuse or neglect are fully investigated. \" A spokeswoman for the district attorney\\'s office in Hidalgo County, which is handling the case, declined to comment. A spokesman for the Texas Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The arrests were first reported by the local television station KRGV. According to the news release from the Department of Family and Protective Services, the agency received a complaint on Nov. 18 about possible abuse at the center. The agency conducted an investigation and found that a female student had been restrained by Ms. Martinez and Ms. Rios, as well as another staff member, on Nov. 17. The girl told investigators that she had been restrained because she would not stop crying, according to the news release. She also said that Ms. Martinez and Ms. Rios had yelled at her and called her a \"bitch\" and a \"whore,\" the news release said. On Nov. 18, the girl was restrained again, this time by Ms. Martinez and Ms. Rios, according to the news release. The girl said that Ms. Martinez and Ms. Rios had threatened to punch her in the face if she did not stop crying, the news release said. After the second incident, the girl was taken to a hospital, where she was treated for bruises and scratches, according to the news release. The girl told investigators that she had been restrained by Ms. Martinez and Ms. Rios on several other occasions, the news release said. Ms. Martinez and Ms. Rios were fired from their jobs at the center on Nov. 22, according to the news release. In a statement, the Texas Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services said that it was \"shocked and deeply saddened\" by the allegations. \"The safety and well being of the individuals we serve is our top priority,\" the statement said. \"We are committed to providing a safe and supportive environment for everyone in our care. \" The department said that it had launched an internal investigation into the allegations and that it was working with the Department of Family and Protective Services to ensure that all allegations of abuse or neglect were fully investigated.',\n",
       " 'Suge Knight was sentenced on Thursday to 28 years in state prison for manslaughter in connection with a 2015 confrontation at a Compton burger stand that left one man dead and another paralyzed. Knight, whose real name is Marion Knight, had pleaded no contest in September to voluntary manslaughter in the death of 55 -year -old Terry Carter. He also pleaded no contest to attempted murder for wounding Cle \"Bone\" Sloan, who was riding in a vehicle with Carter when the two were struck by Knight\\'s pickup truck. Knight, 53, was sentenced by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen, who said he did not have the authority to impose a sentence shorter than the 28 years prosecutors had sought. Knight will be eligible for parole in 10 years. The former rap mogul has spent much of the last two decades in and out of jail and has been linked to several murders. He was acquitted in 1995 of murder in the shooting death of rapper Tupac Shakur. In 1997, he was acquitted of murder in the stabbing death of music producer Andre \"Dr. Dre\" Young. And in 2007, he was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon for attacking Kanye West during an argument outside a Beverly Hills recording studio. He was sentenced to five years in prison, but was released in 2014 after serving about half of his term. In January 2015, Knight was shot six times in the lobby of a West Hollywood nightclub. He was hospitalized for more than a month. Prosecutors say Knight intentionally drove his pickup truck into Carter and Sloan as they stood outside the Straight Outta Compton burger stand in Compton on Jan. 29,2015. Carter died from blunt force trauma to the head and neck. Sloan suffered a spinal cord injury that left him paralyzed from the waist down. Knight\\'s attorney, Matthew Fletcher, told the judge that his client was remorseful and wanted to take responsibility for his actions. \"Mr. Knight wants to apologize to Mr. Carter\\'s family,\" Fletcher said. \"He knows he can\\'t bring Mr. Carter back. \" But Deputy District Attorney John A. McKinney Jr. urged the judge to impose the maximum sentence allowed under the plea deal. \"This defendant is a danger to the community,\" McKinney said. \"His criminal history speaks for itself. \" According to court records, Knight has been arrested at least 20 times since 1983, including arrests for robbery, extortion, assault with a deadly weapon, battery, making terrorist threats and discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling.',\n",

The attack occurred at around 12:30 p.m. local time, when two men and a woman were hit by gunfire as they walked through the square, home to the National Palace and the Metropolitan Cathedral. A fourth victim, a man, was wounded and taken to a hospital, where he was reported to be in serious condition. Police said the attackers fled in a car after the shooting, which took place in front of dozens of horrified onlookers. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but authorities said they were investigating the possibility that it was related to drug trafficking. Mexico City is considered one of the safest major cities in Latin America, but violence linked to drug trafficking has increased in recent years. More than 2,500 people have been killed so far this year in drug related violence, according to official figures.

Police spokesperson Simon Sirro said Thursday that three of the suspects had been arrested on suspicion of negligence. He did not identify them or say what role they played in the operation of the MV Nyerere. The other three were arrested on suspicion of involuntary manslaughter. Sirro said all six will be arraigned in court Friday. The MV Nyerere, which was carrying about 300 passengers, capsized off Tanzania\\'s main island of Zanzibar on April 20 after hitting a reef. Most of the victims were high school students returning to the mainland after a holiday on Zanzibar.

       " 'Warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico helped spawn Hurricane Michael into a Category 4 monster, scientists said on Wednesday, warning that such storms could become more common as the world warms. The hurricane made landfall on the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday afternoon as a Category 4 storm with sustained winds of 155 miles per hour, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was the strongest storm to make landfall in the contiguous United States since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and one of only four Category 4 hurricanes to hit the U.S. mainland. The others were Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, Camille in 1969 and Andrew. \"Climate change is loading the dice for more intense hurricanes like Michael,\" said Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"Hurricanes are driven by warm ocean water, so as the oceans warm due to climate change, we expect to see more intense hurricanes,\" Emanuel told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Scientists say it is difficult to attribute any single extreme weather event to climate change, but there is growing evidence that global warming is making hurricanes wetter and more intense. Climate change is expected to increase the amount of rainfall from tropical storms by about 20 percent by the end of this century, according to an analysis published in 2016 in the journal Nature Climate Change. That study also projected that hurricanes will be up to 10 percent more intense than they would have been without climate change. A study published earlier this year in the journal Geophysical Research Letters found that hurricane rainfall has increased by 20 percent over the past 30 years, and that trend is expected to continue. \"The atmosphere is holding more moisture because of climate change, and that means hurricanes are going to dump more rain when they make landfall,\" said Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. \"It\\'s not a question of if, it\\'s a question of how much.\" NOAA meteorologists who flew into the eyewall of Hurricane Michael on Monday said the storm had a maximum sustained wind of 157 miles per hour, making it the most intense storm ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. The storm is expected to cause $8 billion to $10 billion in insured losses, according to catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark & Co. The company estimated that insured losses from last year\\'s Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 hurricane, totaled $125 billion. Insurance losses from Hurricane Irma, which made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 storm, totaled $50 billion, according to Karen Clark & Co.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii said the quake struck at 10:30 a.m. local time about 120 miles southeast of Kodiak Island, Alaska. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The quake was initially reported as a magnitude 8.2, but the U.S. Geological Survey revised it down to 7.9. The agency said the quake struck at a shallow depth of 6.2 miles below the seabed. The National Weather Service issued a tsunami warning for coastal areas of southern Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and northern California. The warning was later canceled for most locations, but remained in effect for coastal areas of southern Alaska, including Kodiak Island. \"A tsunami is possible within the next three hours,\" the weather service said in a bulletin. \"Tsunami hazard may continue for several hours after the initial wave arrival.\" The agency warned residents along the coast to stay away from beaches and harbors and not to go near the shoreline. Residents were also advised to move their cars to higher ground if they live in an area prone to tsunamis. \"If you are in a coastal area when a tsunami warning is announced, seek higher ground immediately,\" the weather service said. \"A tsunami is a series of waves. You might only see one wave, but that does not mean that other waves are not on the way.\" The USGS said the quake was centered 120 miles southeast of Kodiak Island, Alaska, and 450 miles southwest of Anchorage, Alaska.

In 2015, heavy rainfall triggered flash floods that killed more than 100 people and forced 700,000 to flee their homes. The wetlands have shrunk by 90 percent since the 1940s, according to the United Nations Development Programme. They once covered about 16,000 hectares but are now down to just 1,600 hectares, with much of the land turned into residential areas, parking lots and factories. \"The loss of these wetlands is one of the main reasons why the city is so vulnerable to flooding,\" said UNDP Resident Representative Neil Buhne. \"This project will not only revitalize the wetlands, but it will also help to improve the livelihoods of the people who depend on them.\" The project will be funded by the Global Environment Facility, which is administered by the World Bank, and implemented by the UNDP. It will involve the restoration of 1,600 hectares of wetlands, the creation of new wetlands, and the improvement of water management systems. The project will also include the construction of new drainage systems and the rehabilitation of existing ones, as well as the development of a monitoring and evaluation system to ensure that the wetlands are being properly managed. The project is part of a broader strategy to rehabilitate Sri Lanka\\'s coastal wetlands, which are among the world\\'s most degraded ecosystems.

The agency has placed plastic tubes in the riverbed that are designed to siphon off excess water before it reaches the levees. It's a technique that has been used successfully in other parts of the world, but this is the first time it's been tested in the U.S. NPR's Debbie Elliott reports from Baton Rouge, La. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: This stretch of the Mississippi River is known as the Atchafalaya Basin. It's about 150 miles north of New Orleans, and it's one of the largest wetland areas in the country. That's why the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is experimenting with these plastic tubes here. They're called geotextile tubes, and they look like giant straws. They're buried in the riverbed near the levees. When the water level rises, the tubes suck up the water and direct it back into the river. Lt. Col. Jason Smith with the Corps of Engineers says the tubes are meant to keep the levees from overflowing. JASON SMITH: We're trying to make sure that we don't have any overtopping of the levees so that we can minimize the risk to life and property. ELLIOTT: These tubes have been used in other parts of the world, but this is the first time they've been tried in the U.S. The Corps of Engineers says it's important to test them here because if they work, they could be used in other places along the Mississippi River where flooding is a major concern. There are more than 1,000 miles of levees along the Mississippi River. The Corps of Engineers says it's going to monitor the tubes for the next two years to see how well they work.

       " 'Vietnam\\'s National Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Search and Rescue has warned of heavy rains and strong winds as Tropical Storm Son Tinh makes landfall on the country\\'s central coast. The storm is forecast to make landfall between Quang Ngai and Thua Thien Hue provinces on Wednesday afternoon, the National Center for Hydro Meteorological Forecasting said in a statement. It is expected to bring heavy rainfall and strong winds that could cause flooding and landslides, the center said. The storm was located about 350 km southeast of Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday morning, according to the U.S. Navy\\'s Joint Typhoon Warning Center. It was moving northwest at 12 km per hour with maximum sustained winds of 65 km per hour, the center said. Heavy rains and strong winds associated with the storm have killed at least three people and injured dozens in neighboring Laos, Reuters witnesses and local media reports said. \"We are preparing for the worst,\" said Dao Anh Tuan, deputy director of the Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Search and Rescue under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. \"People should store enough food and water and keep their houses clean to prevent disease outbreaks,\" he told Reuters by telephone. Vietnam is one of the world\\'s most vulnerable countries to natural disasters such as typhoons, floods and droughts due to its long coastline and mountainous terrain. The Southeast Asian nation is prone to flash floods and landslides during the rainy season, which runs from May to October. In 2016, Typhoon Sarika killed more than 80 people and caused widespread damage to crops and infrastructure.

       " 'The U.S. Pacific Northwest is unprepared for tsunamis, despite the risk of devastating earthquakes and tsunamis in the region, according to a report published on Tuesday. The report by the American Geophysical Union said that while there has been progress in preparing for tsunamis since 2004, when a tsunami from an earthquake in Indonesia killed more than 200,000 people, there is still much work to be done. \"The Pacific Northwest remains at risk,\" the report\\'s authors wrote. \"While substantial progress has been made over the past 12 years, significant gaps remain.\" The report called for increased public education about tsunamis, as well as improvements in early warning systems, emergency response plans and building codes. The Pacific Northwest is one of the most seismically active regions in the United States, and is vulnerable to tsunamis caused by earthquakes in the Cascadia subduction zone off the coast of British Columbia and Washington state. In 1964, a magnitude 9.2 earthquake struck Alaska, generating a tsunami that swept across the Pacific Northwest and killed 159 people in Oregon and Washington state. In 2004, a magnitude 9.1 earthquake off the coast of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people in Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India and other countries. Experts have warned that another major earthquake in the Cascadia subduction zone could generate a tsunami that would cause widespread damage and loss of life in the Pacific Northwest. The American Geophysical Union is a nonprofit scientific organization that promotes research and education in the geophysical sciences. The report was authored by a panel of experts from academia, government and the private sector.',\n",

The system made landfall at 1:40 p.m. ET near Mexico Beach, Fla. as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 155 miles per hour, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was the strongest storm to make landfall in the continental US since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. \"This is going to be an unprecedented storm for the Panhandle,\" Gov. Rick Scott warned Tuesday. \"It\\'s going to be historic and it could be catastrophic. \" More than 375,000 homes and businesses were without power by Wednesday afternoon, according to poweroutage. us, which tracks outages across the country. In addition, more than 600,000 people had been ordered to evacuate parts of Florida, Alabama and Georgia ahead of the storm. On Wednesday afternoon, the storm was about 25 miles east of Panama City, Fla. and moving north at 12 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. By 8 p.m. ET, the storm was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph. The storm was forecast to weaken to a tropical storm by Thursday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center. Storm surge and hurricane warnings were in effect from the Okaloosa Island, Fla. to the Suwannee River in Florida and from the Alabama border to the Ocmulgee River in Georgia, according to the National Hurricane Center. A storm surge warning means there is a danger of life threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the coastline, while a hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected within 36 hours. Forecasters warned that Michael could bring up to 12 inches of rain to the Florida Panhandle and southeastern Alabama, with isolated amounts of up to 18 inches. \"This rainfall may produce life threatening flash flooding,\" the National Hurricane Center said. \"The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause usually dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. \" As of 5 p.m. ET Wednesday, the storm was about 50 miles west of Panama City Beach, Fla. and moving north at 12 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The center of the storm was expected to move over the Florida Panhandle or southern Alabama through Wednesday night, before crossing the southeastern corner of Alabama on Thursday and entering southwestern Georgia on Thursday night, according to the National Hurricane Center.',\n",
       " \"BEIJING China has been fighting against floods for thousands of years, but it was not until modern times that the country's flood control capability was greatly enhanced by scientific and technological advances. This year's flood season has just started in China, but the country has already experienced heavy rains and floods in many places, including Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Henan Province, Hubei Province, Sichuan Province, Jiangxi Province, Hunan Province, Anhui Province, Yunnan Province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. In 2015, more than 70 million people in China were affected by floods, with direct economic losses exceeding 100 billion yuan. The Chinese government has attached great importance to flood control and disaster prevention since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, the country has made tremendous progress in flood control and disaster prevention over the past seven decades. A total of 36 major hydropower stations have been built on the mainstreams of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, the Huaihe River, the Liaohe River, the Haihe River, the Songhua River, the Jialing River, the Han River, the Lancang River, the Mekong River and the Brahmaputra River. These dams have effectively controlled floods and droughts, improved the ecological environment and promoted the development of local economies. Over the past seven decades, China has invested more than 2 trillion yuan in flood control and disaster prevention, accounting for nearly one third of the country's total investment in water conservancy projects. During the same period, the country spent more than 1 trillion yuan on emergency flood control and disaster relief work. With these efforts, China has become the world's leading country in terms of spending on flood control and disaster relief. In recent years, China has made great strides in using science and technology to improve flood control and disaster prevention capabilities. For example, the country has adopted remote sensing satellites, aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles to monitor weather conditions and natural disasters. It has also used big data, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence to develop real time flood forecasting and early warning systems. In addition, China has set up a national flood control and drought relief command center and established a national flood control and drought relief emergency response system. These measures have enabled the country to better deal with floods and droughts. More importantly, China has stepped up cooperation with other countries in flood control and disaster prevention. Since 2013, the Ministry of Emergency Management has worked with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the World Meteorological Organization to launch the Global Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, which is aimed at strengthening international cooperation in flood control and disaster prevention. In 2015, the Ministry of Emergency Management signed an agreement on flood control and disaster prevention with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, pledging to strengthen cooperation between China and ASEAN members in this area. In the future, China will continue to make full use of scientific and technological advances to enhance its flood control and disaster prevention capabilities, so as to better safeguard the lives and property of the Chinese people.\",\n",

The Senate approved the bill on Wednesday by a vote of 93 to 7. \"This legislation reflects our bipartisan commitment to supporting our men and women in uniform,\" Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement after the House vote. Mr. Frelinghuysen is expected to become the next chairman of the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. The bill provides $65.8 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, an increase of $1.5 billion over the amount requested by the Obama administration. It also includes $1.5 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations fund, which pays for military operations unrelated to the two wars, including the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The White House had threatened to veto the legislation because it did not include restrictions on the transfer of detainees from Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, to the United States. In a statement, the White House said it was \"disappointed\" that Congress had failed to impose such restrictions. The legislation also includes $1.2 billion for counterterrorism efforts in Yemen, Somalia and Libya, as well as $1.2 billion for the European Reassurance Initiative, a program intended to reassure NATO allies that the United States is committed to defending Europe. The legislation includes a provision that would make it easier for the Air Force to use funds to upgrade the Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and the Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming to handle the new B61 nuclear bomb. And it would require the Air Force to submit a report on how it plans to pay for the refurbishment of the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system. The legislation also includes provisions aimed at helping the Gulf Coast states recover from Hurricane Katrina and other disasters. It requires the Army Corps of Engineers to complete a study of the Mississippi River and Gulf Intracoastal Waterway to determine whether they are vulnerable to future hurricanes. It also directs the corps to conduct a study of the Port of New York and New Jersey to determine whether it is vulnerable to future storm surges. And it requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to establish a program to improve the forecasting of coastal storm surges. The legislation also contains provisions related to the Department of Veterans Affairs, including a requirement that the department provide veterans with free access to mental health care through the Veterans Choice Program. It also requires the department to submit a report to Congress on the number of veterans who have died while awaiting treatment at V.A. hospitals. The legislation does not include any of the amendments proposed by Representative Tulsi Gabbard, Democrat of Hawaii, that would have required the secretary of defense to develop a plan to end the war in Afghanistan.

The water swept away buildings and uprooted trees as it slammed into Palu\\'s beachfront and along the length of its main street. Footage from the city showed waves crashing over palm trees and engulfing houses. There were also reports of a tsunami in the town of Donggala, located on a peninsula just across a narrow strait from Palu. \"It was like a giant waving its hand,\" said Muhammad Idris, who was in Donggala when the tsunami struck. \"There was no warning at all.

Timothy Hennis, 23, showed he was killed by a single gunshot wound to his head. Both soldiers were found dead Wednesday in their living quarters at the Grafenwoehr Training Area, about 60 miles southwest of Munich. Authorities are investigating the deaths as homicides but have not yet named any suspects. Prosecutor Thomas Steinkraus told the AP that the suspect had links to Al Qaida. He declined to provide further details, citing an ongoing investigation. It was not immediately clear if the suspect is in custody or under surveillance. In Afghanistan, where the U.S. military has been fighting the Taliban for more than a decade, it is not uncommon for suspected insurgents to be linked to Al Qaida. However, it is unusual for such a link to be established in Germany, where the country\\'s domestic intelligence agency, the Bundesamt fur Verfassungsschutz, has repeatedly warned that Islamic extremists pose the greatest threat to the country\\'s security.

       " 'The diary of a top Nazi official has resurfaced, more than 70 years after it was hidden away by a young German girl to save it from being confiscated by the Allies. The diary, which belonged to Adolf Hitler\\'s secretary, Traudl Junge, is one of the most intimate records of the Third Reich. It contains detailed accounts of Hitler\\'s last days in his Berlin bunker during World War II, when he committed suicide on April 30,1945. The diary also includes descriptions of Hitler\\'s private life, including what he ate and drank, as well as details of his personal relationships with Eva Braun, his mistress, and Joseph Goebbels, the propaganda minister. The diary was first published in 2002, but only in German. Now an English translation has been published by the New York publisher Henry Holt & Co. The diary was discovered in 2008 by a woman named Inge Scholl, who was born in Germany in 1921. Her father was one of the founders of the White Rose, a group of German students who distributed leaflets urging Germans to resist the Nazi regime. Scholl\\'s father, Hans Scholl, was executed in 1943 for distributing the leaflets. After the war, Scholl\\'s mother, Sophie Scholl, became a member of the Social Democratic Party and served as a member of the Bundestag, the German parliament, from 1953 until her death in 1972. Scholl said she had always been intrigued by her mother\\'s relationship with Hitler. She said she knew her mother had been involved in a love triangle with Hitler and Goebbels, but she didn\\'t know the details. \"I wanted to know more about my mother,\" she said in an interview with The New York Times. \"I wanted to know what kind of person she was. I wanted to know how she could have fallen in love with such a monster.\" Scholl said she began searching for the diary after her mother\\'s death in 1972. She said she asked her mother\\'s friends and relatives if they had any information about the diary, but no one knew where it was. Scholl said she finally found the diary in 2008, when she was clearing out her mother\\'s apartment in Munich. Scholl said she came across the diary while sorting through some old photographs. She said she recognized the handwriting on the diary as her mother\\'s. Scholl said she took the diary to a friend, who told her that it was probably worth a lot of money. Scholl said she did not want to sell the diary, so she decided to keep it. She said she showed the diary to a few people, but no one seemed interested in buying it. Scholl said she kept the diary in a safe deposit box for several years, but she eventually decided to sell it. She said she contacted a German publisher, who offered to buy the diary for $1 million. Scholl said she declined the offer, because she did not want to sell the diary to a German publisher. She said she then contacted a British publisher, who offered to buy the diary for $2 million. Scholl said she agreed to sell the diary to the British publisher, but she did not want to reveal the identity of the buyer. Scholl said she plans to donate the proceeds from the sale of the diary to charity.',\n",

       " 'A federal judge has cleared the way for Detroit\\'s bankruptcy case to go forward, ruling that the city\\'s creditors don\\'t have legal standing to challenge the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes made the ruling late Wednesday in an opinion issued after a two day trial. A group of retiree pensioners had sued to block Detroit\\'s bankruptcy filing in July 2013, arguing that the city did not have the right to file for bankruptcy under Michigan state law. They also argued that if the city was allowed to file for bankruptcy, it would violate the U.S. Constitution\\'s ban on impairing the obligations of contracts. Rhodes disagreed with both arguments. \"The Court finds that plaintiffs lack standing to pursue their constitutional claims,\" Rhodes wrote. The ruling comes as Detroit emerges from its bankruptcy case. The city exited bankruptcy in December 2014 after reaching a settlement with its creditors. It was the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Retirees who challenged the city\\'s bankruptcy were represented by attorneys from the Pacific Legal Foundation, a nonprofit public interest law firm based in Sacramento, Calif. \"We respectfully disagree with the court\\'s decision and are considering our next steps,\" said Timothy Sandefur, a senior attorney at the Pacific Legal Foundation. Attorneys representing the city of Detroit did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In his ruling, Rhodes dismissed the argument that Detroit\\'s bankruptcy violated the U.S. Constitution\\'s ban on impairing the obligations of contracts. He cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year that upheld a Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy filing by Stockton, Calif. That ruling held that states have the power to authorize municipalities to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Rhodes also rejected the argument that Detroit\\'s bankruptcy violated Michigan state law. He noted that the Michigan Legislature has authorized local governments to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. \"Chapter 9 of the United States Bankruptcy Code is the exclusive means by which a municipality may seek relief under federal bankruptcy laws,\" Rhodes wrote. \"Plaintiffs do not dispute that Chapter 9 provides the exclusive means by which a debtor may seek relief under federal bankruptcy laws. Instead, plaintiffs insist that Chapter 9 does not provide the exclusive means by which a municipality may seek relief under federal bankruptcy laws. ... Plaintiffs\\' contention that Chapter 9 does not constitute the exclusive means by which a municipality may seek relief under federal bankruptcy laws is without merit.\"',\n",
       " \"The former president of Guatemala, Otto Perez Molina, was extradited to the United States on Saturday to face charges that he accepted millions of dollars in bribes while in office. Mr. Perez Molina, 64, was flown to the United States from Guatemala City on Friday night, according to a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Guatemala. He was expected to appear in federal court in Brooklyn on Monday. Mr. Perez Molina, who was president from 2012 to 2015, is accused of accepting at least $2.5 million in bribes from a company called Odebrecht, a Brazilian conglomerate that has been implicated in corruption scandals around the world. Prosecutors say Mr. Perez Molina took the bribes between 2013 and 2015, when he was still in office. Mr. Perez Molina was arrested in Guatemala in September 2015, after his successor, President Jimmy Morales, ordered the country's attorney general to investigate allegations that Mr. Perez Molina had taken bribes from Odebrecht. Mr. Perez Molina has denied the accusations. A judge in Guatemala ruled in December that Mr. Perez Molina could be extradited to the United States, where prosecutors have charged him with conspiracy to commit bribery and money laundering. If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison. Mr. Perez Molina is the second former president of Guatemala to be extradited to the United States in recent years. In 2013, Efraín Ríos Montt, who led Guatemala from 1982 to 1983, was sent to the United States to face charges that he had committed genocide and crimes against humanity during his time in power. Mr. Ríos Montt was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013, but the conviction was overturned by Guatemala's Constitutional Court in 2015.\",\n",
       " 'The second leader of Tunisia\\'s main opposition party was assassinated on Wednesday, in an attack that underscored the nation\\'s fragile transition to democracy and its vulnerability to Islamist extremism. Chokri Belaid, the secretary general of the secular Progressive Democratic Party, was gunned down outside his home in Tunis as he walked to his car. He was the second opposition leader to be assassinated since the 2011 revolution that toppled the country\\'s longtime dictator, Zine el Abidine Ben Ali. The first, Mohamed Brahmi, was killed in July 2013. Mr. Belaid, 48, was a fierce critic of President Moncef Marzouki, who has been in office since December 2011. He accused Mr. Marzouki of being too close to the Muslim Brotherhood, the group that propelled the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, to power last year before he was overthrown by the military. Mr. Belaid also blamed Mr. Marzouki for failing to rein in political corruption and for not doing enough to curb unemployment, which stands at about 17 percent. In a statement, Mr. Marzouki called Mr. Belaid\\'s killing \"a cowardly terrorist act\" and offered his condolences to Mr. Belaid\\'s wife and children. On Wednesday evening, hundreds of people took to the streets of Tunis to protest Mr. Belaid\\'s death. Many chanted, \"The people want the fall of the regime,\" a slogan that became the rallying cry of the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011. The Tunisian Interior Ministry said it had opened an investigation into Mr. Belaid\\'s killing. The police said they had arrested two suspects, one of whom was identified as Hichem Khlifi, a former member of the Ennahda Party, the Islamist group that won Tunisia\\'s first democratic elections in 2011. Reuters reported that Mr. Khlifi had been expelled from Ennahda in 2012 for violating the party\\'s code of ethics. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Mr. Belaid\\'s killing, but suspicion immediately fell on Islamist militants. Tunisia has struggled to maintain stability since the ouster of Mr. Ben Ali, who ruled the country with an iron fist for 23 years. Violence has spiked in recent months, with attacks on foreign tourists and security forces. More than 60 people were killed in a suicide bombing at a beach resort in Sousse last month. And in June, 38 people were killed when gunmen stormed the national museum in Tunis. Most of those attacks were claimed by the Islamic State, though analysts have questioned whether the militant group has the ability to carry out such large operations in Tunisia. Still, experts say that Tunisia\\'s instability poses a threat to neighboring Libya, which has become a haven for Islamist militants fleeing air strikes by the United States and its allies in Syria and Iraq.',\n",

The agreement with National General Holdings Corp. resolves a lawsuit filed in 2014 by Schneiderman and other state attorneys general alleging that National General improperly denied coverage to people who had preexisting conditions, such as cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are required to cover people with preexisting conditions without charging them higher premiums or denying them coverage altogether. National General, which is based in Fort Washington, Pa. and does business in New York under the name Integon Indemnity Co. , did not admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. \"National General put profits over people by denying coverage to tens of thousands of New Yorkers,\" Schneiderman said in a statement. \"Today\\'s settlement holds National General accountable for its unlawful conduct and sends a clear message that insurers must comply with the law.\" As part of the deal, National General will also pay $500,000 in penalties to the state.

       " 'Three former Penn State officials were ordered to stand trial on charges that they failed to report child sexual abuse allegations against Jerry Sandusky, the former assistant football coach who was convicted of molesting 10 boys. Judge John M. Cleland of the Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas in Harrisburg, Pa. on Thursday denied motions by the three defendants to dismiss the charges against them. The three men - former Penn State president Graham B. Spanier, former vice president Gary C. Schultz and former athletic director Tim Curley - are charged with endangering the welfare of children, obstruction of justice, conspiracy and official misconduct. Mr. Sandusky, 68, was convicted in June 2012 on 45 counts of sexually abusing 10 boys over a period of 15 years. He is serving a sentence of 30 to 60 years in state prison. In his ruling on Thursday, Judge Cleland found that there was sufficient evidence to support the charges against the three defendants. \"The court finds that the Commonwealth has met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that each of the defendants committed the offenses as charged,\" Judge Cleland wrote in his ruling. Prosecutors have argued that the three men had a legal obligation under Pennsylvania law to report suspected child abuse to the state\\'s child welfare agency, known as the Department of Public Welfare. But defense lawyers have argued that the law did not apply to them because they were not employees of Penn State, which is a private university. Judge Cleland also rejected their arguments that the statute of limitations had run out on the charges against them. Their next court appearance is scheduled for Jan. 22. After Mr. Sandusky\\'s arrest in November 2011, the three defendants were charged with failing to report suspected child abuse. They were indicted in February 2012. All three men have pleaded not guilty. If convicted, they could face up to seven years in prison and fines of up to $15,000.',\n",

It did not identify the assistant principal by name. A spokesman for the United Federation of Teachers, which represents 75,000 teachers and other school employees, said the union is cooperating with the investigation. \"The UFT takes any allegation of sexual misconduct very seriously and we will continue to work with the DOE as they conduct their investigation,\" said Michael Mulgrew, the union\\'s president, in a statement. The DOE declined to comment further on the specifics of the allegations against the assistant principal, citing the ongoing investigation. An attorney for the assistant principal did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to the DOE, the assistant principal engaged in \"sexually inappropriate conduct\" with four students, all of whom are under the age of 17. The DOE said the assistant principal violated several policies, including one that prohibits employees from engaging in sexual conduct with a student. The assistant principal began working at Jamaica High School in September 2015, according to the DOE.

Marlon Jones, 34, was found guilty last month of killing Detectives Rodney Andrews and James Nemorin as they posed as drug dealers in Staten Island, N.Y. He was convicted of two counts of first degree murder, two counts of second degree murder, two counts of attempted murder and one count of criminal possession of a weapon. The Associated Press reported that the jury deliberated for about four hours before reaching its verdict. \"It\\'s a very sad day for New York City,\" Police Commissioner William Bratton said at a news conference after the sentence was handed down. \"This is an individual who has no regard for the sanctity of human life. \" Mr. Jones shot Detectives Andrews and Nemorin while they were sitting in an unmarked police van parked outside a bodega in Staten Island on Feb. 12,2007. Detective Andrews, 48, died at the scene, while Detective Nemorin, 33, was taken to a hospital, where he died three days later. Both officers were assigned to the department\\'s plainclothes narcotics unit. At the time of the shooting, Mr. Jones was wanted for questioning in connection with the robbery of a drug dealer. According to prosecutors, Mr. Jones had previously robbed another drug dealer, stole his cellphone and used it to set up a fake drug deal with Detectives Andrews and Nemorin. Prosecutors argued that Mr. Jones panicked and opened fire when he realized he was being robbed. But defense lawyers contended that Detectives Andrews and Nemorin, who were wearing bulletproof vests, were the aggressors and that Mr. Jones acted in self defense. Defense lawyers also argued that Detective Nemorin, who was carrying a gun, fired the first shot, hitting Mr. Jones in the leg. In closing arguments, Assistant District Attorney Matthew Bogdanos told the jury that Mr. Jones had planned to kill the officers from the moment he met them. \"The defendant didn\\'t care if he got killed,\" Mr. Bogdanos said. \"He wanted to kill these cops. \" Mr. Jones, who did not take the stand during the trial, testified in his own defense, telling jurors that Detective Nemorin shot him first.

The National Election Committee said Hun Sen\\'s Cambodian People\\'s Party had won 68 out of 125 seats in the National Assembly, just ahead of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party with 55 seats. The CNRP was hoping to unseat Hun Sen, who has been in power since 1985, after a campaign marred by violence and allegations of irregularities. The CNRP said it would not accept the election results, calling them a \"farce\" and vowing to continue protests against what it said was a rigged vote. \"The CNRP will not participate in any process that violates the people\\'s will,\" party leader Sam Rainsy said in a statement. \"We will continue to use peaceful means to expose the illegitimacy of this regime.\" Hun Sen, 64, has ruled Cambodia with an iron fist, stifling dissent and cracking down on political opponents. He has also presided over an economy that has grown steadily since the end of a devastating civil war in 1975, but corruption is rife and poverty remains widespread. The United States and European Union have both expressed concern over the conduct of the polls. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States was \"gravely concerned\" about reports of voter intimidation, ballot stuffing and other irregularities. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the bloc was \"deeply worried\" about the outcome of the election. Hundreds of people were injured in clashes between supporters of the two parties in the run up to the vote.

       " 'WASHINGTON - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Thursday that it was invoking rarely used emergency powers to crack down on high frequency trading, which has come under scrutiny by regulators in the United States and around the world. The agency\\'s commissioners voted 3 to 2 to invoke the \"emergency action\" provision of the Commodity Exchange Act, which allows the agency to take immediate action to protect against an imminent threat to the markets. In a statement announcing the action, the agency said it had determined that market participants were engaging in manipulative trading practices that threatened to destabilize the markets. It did not identify any specific trader or trading firm. The CFTC said it would use its emergency powers to issue an order prohibiting certain trading practices and to require traders to disclose information about their activities. The agency also said it would be working with other regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, to investigate possible violations of federal securities laws. The CFTC is one of several U.S. regulators that have expressed concern about high frequency trading, which uses computer algorithms to quickly buy and sell securities. The practice has been blamed for contributing to last year\\'s \"flash crash,\" when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 600 points in a matter of minutes before rebounding. Regulators have also raised concerns about the potential for high frequency trading to disrupt markets. The CFTC\\'s emergency powers were last used in 2008, when the agency invoked them to impose restrictions on oil trading during a period of high volatility in the energy markets.',\n",

Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf has said the San Francisco bank will cut $1 billion in expenses by the end of 2017. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Richele Messick declined to comment on the job cuts. Bloomberg first reported the layoffs. Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, had 264,900 employees as of Dec. 31, according to regulatory filings. That was up 3 percent from a year earlier, when it had about 256,000 workers. Wells Fargo has more than 8,000 branches in 36 states and the District of Columbia. It's the second largest U.S. bank by assets, behind JPMorgan Chase & Co. The job cuts come as Wells Fargo seeks to rebound from a scandal that erupted in September over its sales practices. Federal regulators fined the bank $185 million and barred it from growing until it improves its oversight and risk management. Stumpf resigned under pressure from the bank's board of directors after lawmakers grilled him about the bank's sales practices at a Senate hearing in October. He received $134 million in compensation in 2015, making him one of the highest paid executives in the U.S. The bank also faces a lawsuit from the city of Los Angeles accusing it of defrauding homeowners during the housing crisis.

De Blasio\\'s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposed legislation. In 2014, Gov. Cuomo signed into law a bill that allows people to carry concealed guns after taking a course and undergoing background checks. Last year, he vetoed another bill that would have allowed people to carry concealed guns without a permit.

       " 'A man who was left in a cell overnight by the Drug Enforcement Administration has agreed to settle his civil rights lawsuit against the agency for $25,000, his attorney said Tuesday. The Justice Department reached the settlement with Robert Pena, 39, of Los Angeles, who alleged he was detained at the DEA\\'s San Diego office in March 2014 on suspicion of being a drug trafficker and then held in a cell overnight without food, water or a bathroom. He was not charged with any crime. Pena\\'s attorney, Matthew Strugar, said his client will also receive $7,500 to cover his legal fees. \"Mr. Pena is relieved that the matter has been resolved,\" Strugar said in a statement. \"He looks forward to moving on with his life.\" The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to court documents, Pena was detained by DEA agents after they received an anonymous tip that he was involved in a drug trafficking ring. He was handcuffed and taken to the DEA\\'s San Diego office, where he was questioned for several hours before being told he was free to go. Instead, he was placed in a holding cell, where he spent the night. The next morning, he was given a bagel and orange juice. He was not allowed to make a phone call or use the bathroom, according to court documents. Pena filed a lawsuit against the DEA in April 2015, alleging he was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. His attorneys have argued that the DEA violated Pena\\'s Fourth Amendment rights by detaining him without probable cause. They also alleged that the agency violated Pena\\'s Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by subjecting him to \"degrading and humiliating\" treatment. The Justice Department has denied the allegations, arguing that Pena was properly detained and that the conditions of his confinement were not unconstitutional. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the DEA has agreed to pay Pena $25,000 in damages and $7,500 in attorney\\'s fees. The agency has also agreed to implement new policies and procedures to ensure that detainees are treated humanely and with dignity. The settlement comes as the DEA faces increased scrutiny over its use of force and its treatment of detainees. In recent years, the agency has been accused of using excessive force against suspects, including the use of Tasers and pepper spray. The agency has also been criticized for its treatment of detainees, including the use of solitary confinement and the denial of basic amenities such as food and water. The settlement with Pena is the latest in a series of settlements the Justice Department has reached with individuals who have alleged that they were subjected to cruel and unusual punishment by government officials. In recent years, the department has reached settlements with individuals who were held in solitary confinement for extended periods of time, subjected to physical and verbal abuse, and denied access to medical care. The settlement with Pena highlights the importance of holding government officials accountable for their actions and ensuring that detainees are treated humanely and with dignity. It also underscores the need for greater oversight and transparency in the criminal justice system, particularly when it comes to the treatment of detainees. While the settlement with Pena is a step in the right direction, it is important to remember that there are still many individuals who have been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment by government officials. It is essential that we continue to hold those officials accountable and work to ensure that all detainees are treated humanely and with dignity.',\n",

       " 'BEIRUT - Syrian warplanes and helicopters have stepped up attacks on rebel positions in northwestern Syria, activists said Wednesday, a day after government forces captured a strategic town near the border with Turkey. The Britain\\'s Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 12 civilians were killed in air strikes Tuesday on the town of Maarat al Numan, which lies on the M5 highway that links the capital, Damascus, to Aleppo, Syria\\'s largest city. The highway is a vital supply route for President Bashar Assad\\'s government, which has lost control over most of the country\\'s territory since the start of the civil war in 2011. The Syrian military says it has inflicted \"heavy losses\" on rebels who attacked Maarat al Numan on Tuesday, killing dozens of fighters and capturing weapons and ammunition. The Observatory, which reports on the violence through a network of activists on the ground, put the death toll from the fighting at more than 100. The Syrian Civil Defense, a volunteer organization also known as the White Helmets, said at least 40 civilians were killed in the bombardment of Maarat al Numan. The group, which operates in rebel held areas, said its rescue workers had recovered the bodies of at least 18 children and 12 women. The Syrian military said it was responding to an attack on Maarat al Numan by \"terrorist groups\" and accused opposition fighters of using civilians as human shields. The Observatory said Syrian government troops advanced into Maarat al Numan on Tuesday after days of intense clashes with rebels. It said the capture of Maarat al Numan would allow the government to reopen the highway between Damascus and Aleppo, which has been closed since 2012. The Syrian military said in a statement carried by the state news agency SANA late Tuesday that the town had been cleared of \"terrorists\" and that the army was continuing to advance toward the nearby town of Khan Touman. The battle for Maarat al Numan is part of a broader offensive launched by the Syrian military earlier this month to regain control of Idlib province, which is dominated by insurgent groups. The Syrian military has made significant gains in recent weeks, taking control of several towns and villages in northern Hama province. At least 300,000 people have been killed in Syria\\'s civil war, which began with peaceful protests against Assad\\'s government in March 2011 but escalated into a full blown civil war after a crackdown by security forces. More than 11 million people have been displaced inside Syria, and more than 5 million have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations. Associated Press writer Albert Aji contributed to this report from Damascus, Syria.',\n",
       " 'The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is ramping up its scrutiny of high frequency trading firms, according to people familiar with the situation. The brokerage regulator has increased its inspections of these firms, which use computer algorithms to buy and sell stocks in fractions of a second, in an effort to ensure that they are complying with rules put in place after the May 2010 \"flash crash,\" when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 600 points before rebounding. FINRA is also taking a closer look at the firms\\' books and records, as well as their disclosures to clients, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. FINRA spokesman Ray Pellecchia declined to comment. In the wake of the 2010 flash crash, regulators implemented a number of new rules aimed at improving the transparency and stability of the U.S. stock market. They include a requirement that all orders placed by high speed trading firms be submitted to exchanges at the same time, rather than being staggered. FINRA also requires firms to disclose how much of their trading volume is attributable to high frequency trading. Firms must also disclose any material conflicts of interest between themselves and their customers. And the Securities and Exchange Commission last month proposed a rule that would require high frequency trading firms to register with the agency as brokers or dealers, giving regulators access to data on their trading activities. High speed trading firms have come under fire in recent years for their role in contributing to volatility in the markets. Critics have also accused them of front running, or trading ahead of large customer orders, and spoofing, or submitting fake orders to mislead other traders into thinking there is more demand for a stock than there actually is. But supporters of high speed trading argue that it provides liquidity to the markets and helps keep trading costs low for investors. Copyright 2016 by The New York Times Company. All rights reserved.

       " 'Washington President Barack Obama will nominate former Justice Department official James Comey to be the next director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, two U.S. officials said on Friday. Comey, 52, is a Republican who served as deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration and has been a partner at Lockheed Martin\\'s law firm since 2010. He would replace Robert Mueller, who was named special counsel last week to oversee the Justice Department\\'s investigation into Russia\\'s alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible ties to Donald Trump\\'s campaign team. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the nomination before Obama formally announces it. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation. Comey previously served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2002 to 2005, during which time he prosecuted Martha Stewart for insider trading. He also served as general counsel at Lockheed Martin from 2005 to 2010. During his time at the Justice Department, Comey was responsible for overseeing the government\\'s response to the Sept. 11,2001, terrorist attacks, according to his biography on the Lockheed Martin website. In 2013, Comey told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that the National Security Agency\\'s collection of Americans\\' telephone records under Section 215 of the Patriot Act was \"inconsistent with the 4th Amendment.\" The amendment protects Americans from unreasonable searches and seizures by the federal government.

       " 'Washington Caroline Kennedy, the only surviving child of President John F. Kennedy, has been nominated by President Barack Obama to be the next U.S. ambassador to Japan, the White House announced Thursday. If confirmed by the Senate, she would be the first woman to serve as U.S. ambassador to Japan. \"Caroline Kennedy is one of our nation\\'s fiercest and most effective advocates for American leadership in the world,\" Obama said in a statement. \"She has devoted her career to public service, and I am confident that she will be an extraordinary ambassador to Japan.\" The announcement ends months of speculation about who Obama would nominate to replace Ambassador Caroline B. Kennedy, who has served in Tokyo since 2013. In addition to being the president\\'s niece, she is also the granddaughter of former President John F. Kennedy and the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, who served as U.S. attorney general under his brother and was assassinated while running for president in 1968. Her mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, married Aristotle Onassis, a Greek shipping magnate, in 1968. She died of cancer in 1994. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1988, Kennedy worked at the New York City law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell, where she specialized in securities litigation. In 1994, she became counsel to the Manhattan district attorney\\'s office, where she prosecuted white collar crimes. In 1998, she became chief counsel to New York Gov. George E. Pataki. She left government service in 2002 to join the New York City Commission on Human Rights, where she served as deputy chief until 2004, when she joined the board of directors of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. In 2008, she published a memoir, \"A Patriot\\'s Handbook: Songs, Poems, Stories, Speeches, and Readings Celebrating the Music of Freedom,\" which included writings by Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr. and Teddy Roosevelt.

       " 'Gyula Horn, who as Hungary\\'s last Communist prime minister helped tear down his country\\'s Iron Curtain and led its transition to democracy, has died at the age of 80. Mr. Horn, who had been battling cancer, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Budapest, according to an announcement by Prime Minister Viktor Orban\\'s press office. Mr. Horn served as prime minister from 1994 to 1998, overseeing Hungary\\'s transformation from a Soviet satellite to a member of the European Union. \"Hungary owes a debt of gratitude to Gyula Horn,\" Mr. Orban said in a statement. \"He was one of the main architects of the democratic changes in Hungary.\" Mr. Horn became prime minister in 1994 when his party, the Hungarian Socialist Party, came to power after winning a landslide victory in parliamentary elections. It was the first free election in Hungary since 1947. Mr. Horn was born in 1932 in the northeastern city of Miskolc. He joined the Communist Party in 1949 and spent much of his early career working as a trade union organizer. In 1956, he was jailed for taking part in the failed uprising against the Communist regime. He was released two years later and allowed to emigrate to West Germany, where he studied economics and law. He returned to Hungary in 1963 and resumed his career in the Communist Party. After the fall of Communism in 1989, Mr. Horn emerged as a leading figure in the Hungarian Socialist Party. During his tenure as prime minister, Mr. Horn pushed for Hungary to join the European Union, which it finally did in 2004. He also oversaw the privatization of Hungary\\'s state enterprises and signed a treaty with Slovakia that ended a long border dispute between the two countries. Mr. Horn left politics in 1998 but continued to be active in civil society. He was a vocal critic of Mr. Orban\\'s increasingly authoritarian government. In 2015, Mr. Horn was awarded the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.',\n",
       " 'A Syrian opposition group has released what it says are photographs of the bodies of 25 soldiers killed by Islamic State militants in Palmyra. The Britainbased Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the mass execution took place near the ancient city of Palmyra on Wednesday. The group said the men were members of the Syrian army\\'s Tiger Force, which is made up of Shiite militiamen from Lebanon and Iraq. The area around Palmyra has been under IS control since May 2015, when Syrian government forces abandoned the city. Syrian troops recaptured Palmyra from IS in March after a fierce battle that lasted more than a month. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said IS fighters captured the Tiger Force soldiers as they were fleeing Palmyra toward the nearby town of Sukhnah. The group said some of the soldiers were executed on the spot, while others were taken back to Palmyra, where they were shot dead. The photos show the bodies of the dead soldiers lined up in a row, with their hands tied behind their backs. Some of the men appear to have gunshot wounds to the head. It was not immediately possible to independently confirm the authenticity of the photos. The Syrian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the mass execution appears to be the latest in a series of similar killings carried out by IS. In December, the group released photos showing the bodies of dozens of Syrian soldiers who it said had been executed in the eastern city of Deir el Zour. The U.N. human rights office condemned the killings at the time, saying they appeared to be \"war crimes. \" More than 250,000 people have been killed since Syria\\'s conflict began in 2011 with protests against President Bashar Assad.',\n",
       " 'New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio sued the city comptroller on Tuesday to try to stop him from blocking contracts with companies that do business with the state of Israel. De Blasio, a Democrat who is seeking reelection this year, filed the lawsuit against Comptroller Scott Stringer in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. The mayor\\'s office accused Stringer of violating the city\\'s Administrative Code by trying to impose his own foreign policy on the city government. \"The Comptroller\\'s actions are an unprecedented attempt to micromanage the financial decisions of the City,\" the lawsuit said. Stringer spokeswoman Olivia Lapeyrolerie said the comptroller\\'s office was reviewing the lawsuit. De Blasio, who supports the Palestinian cause, last month suspended $5.3 million in city contracts with two companies that do business with Israel, citing their activities in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. He has also urged other cities and states not to do business with those companies. Stringer, who is also a Democrat, disagreed with de Blasio\\'s move, saying it went against the city\\'s contracting rules. He issued subpoenas for information about the city\\'s contracts with Elbit Systems Ltd and its subsidiary, Elbit Systems of America Inc, as well as Motorola Solutions Inc . In response, de Blasio told Stringer he could not block the contracts because they were signed before he took office in January 2014. De Blasio\\'s lawsuit seeks a court order barring Stringer from interfering with the city\\'s contracts with Elbit and Motorola.

       " 'President Barack Obama on Thursday nominated veteran diplomat Antony Blinken to be his next secretary of State, defying critics who wanted him to choose someone with more experience in foreign policy. Blinken, 56, has served as Obama\\'s deputy national security adviser since 2013. He is seen as a close confidant of Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Blinken would succeed Hillary Clinton, who stepped down from the post in February after losing her bid for the presidency to Republican Donald Trump. Blinken said he was \"deeply honored\" by Obama\\'s decision. \"I look forward to working with the president, the vice president, and my colleagues at the State Department to advance our country\\'s interests and values around the world,\" he said in a statement. The choice of Blinken had been criticized by some Republicans and Democrats alike, including Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must approve any nominee. Corker told reporters on Wednesday that Blinken did not have enough experience to lead the State Department. A senior administration official said Blinken was chosen because of his ability to work across the government and his familiarity with the issues facing the State Department. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Blinken also had strong relationships with foreign leaders. Blinken began his career as a staffer for New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. He later served as a top aide to Bill Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas. As deputy national security adviser, Blinken oversaw the implementation of the Iran nuclear deal and the normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba. He also played a key role in the administration\\'s negotiations with Russia over the crisis in Ukraine. Blinken will now need to be confirmed by the Senate before he can take over as secretary of State. His confirmation hearings are expected to begin in early January.
