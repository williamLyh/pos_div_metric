Web-GPT,How much could the Pope's speeches affect policies and decisions in Catholic countries?,2erdo1,Human demonstration,"As the head of the Catholic Church, the Pope has a strong influence over the politics in majority-Catholic countries such as Italy, Latin American countries, or some South American countries. However, the church's positions on political issues are usually presented subtly by church Cardinals or in opinions from the Vatican voiced by the Pope rather than independent speeches from the Pope. A modern example of church influence over a political issue is the church-supported ban on abortion in Argentina. Another example is the government proposal to extend property taxes to church property in Italy, which has been fiercely opposed by politicians with private connections to the Vatican. While countries may not directly respond to the Pope or the Church taking policy positions, the Pope's opinions can sway Catholic voters and politicians in democratic countries where country leaders use religion to appeal to the people.","['As the head of the Catholic Church, the Pope has a strong influence over the politics in majority-Catholic countries such as Italy, Latin American countries, or some South American countries.'

ELI5,How do hundreds of animators work together on the same project file when making a big budget animated movie?,513u1h,d796nrc,"You don't usually work on the same files because everything is split up between the departments. I haven't used USD yet but I have encountered the following workflow in different studios (using Maya). 

For example: a character that has been rigged by one (or more, but not at the same time) rigger goes to the animators. Every animator works with the same character rig BUT each animator works on his/her own shot. He/She references (or ""links"") the rig into their scene so that any change that is later made to the rig can be updated in the animators' scenes as well.
The environment of that scene is usually a rough blockout, done in the modeling department. It contains all the objects the animator needs to set up and let the character act in his/her shot.
Then the scene gets switched out with the final scene (with textures, shading, lights and details) and the character rig is often updated as well, to get any dynamic stuff like hair, cloth and the hires render meshes in there. This is often done in separate departments as well, depending on the size of the studio. 
This is my simple depiction of the process and it varies from studio to studio. I would love to read some more experiences, also about USD, if anyone has worked with it or with a different pipeline.","[""You don't usually work on the same files because everything is split up between the departments.""

Web-GPT,Who are the Kurdish people?,2d1g91,Human demonstration,"Kurdish people (also referred to as Kurds) are a distinct ethnic group which resides in a mountainous region of Western Asian which spans southeastern Turkey, northwestern Iran, northern Iraq, and northern Syria.  This area is known as Kurdistan but is not a sovereign country. There are also exclaves of Kurds in Central Anatolia, Khorasan, and the Caucasus, as well as significant Kurdish diaspora communities in the cities of western Turkey and Western Europe. The Kurdish population is estimated to be between 30 and 45 million.  Kurdish people share a common identity and language which emerged around the Middle Ages.

The term Kurdish originated following the Muslim conquest of Persia and was adopted into Arabic to become associated with an amalgamation of Iranian and Iranicised tribes and groups in the region.  Many Kurds consider themselves descended from the Medes, an ancient Iranian people, and even use a calendar dating from 612 BC, when the Assyrian capital of Nineveh was conquered by the Medes. The claimed Median descent is reflected in the words of the Kurdish national anthem: ""We are the children of the Medes and Kai Khosrow.""

ELI5,How come people don't borrow from low-interest rate countries like Japan and deposit it in high-interest rate countries like Argentina?,2umsnl,co9y9wt,"Victor, this occurs regularly, although it is difficult for individual investors to do.

The trade you are discussing has happened in the past, and is likely happening today. In finance parlance, this is known as a carry trade. The best known carry trade was in the 90's, going short (selling, or owing) the Japanese yen and going long (buying, or owning) the US dollar.

The key to the carry trade is exactly what you described. It is not simply a matter of being short one currency and long another, but it is being short one currency and long another with a view towards profiting off of the interest rate differentials. 

In the JPY/USD example, you would be selling JPY that had interest rates of near 0% and buying the USD with interest rates of near 5%. So, you are paying a near 0% interest rate per year towards people you owed JPY, but receiving a 5% interest rate per year from your ownership of USD. If, on a relative basis, the JPY appreciates (gets more expensive) by 5% or more per year, you would lose money as this would wipe out your gains from the interest rate differential. If the currency moves the other way, with JPY getting cheaper relative to USD, you could stand to make a lot of money this way. If the currencies remain flat, on a relative basis, you would be pocketing the 5% per year interest rate differential.

One of the reasons this is hard for individuals to do is that you are unlikely able to borrow at headline interest rates unless you have sizable banking relationships. In addition, there are numerous risks, including currency exchange rate movements (one currency getting cheaper or more expensive relative to the other), interest rate changes (thus removing the positive interest rate differential you are gaining), among others.","['Victor, this occurs regularly, although it is difficult for individual investors to do.\n'

ELI5,How do bugs in games occur?,6okvnt,dki51ia,"Hallo, Computer Scientist here. 

Bugs are almost never typos, they can be, but this is rarely the case as if you just misspell a variable, for example, your code simply won't compile. Basically, you push Go! and the computer just laughs at you in this case.

More often in any kind of software, not just games mind you, the code interacts in a way that the programmer didn't expect. For example, the programmer thought that some variable, X, could _never_ be a negative number. Then, when the code (game, in our case) is running, it ends up being a negative number, and the code interacts in a way the programmer never expected it to.

This normally happens at a large level because several, if not dozens or even hundreds, of programmers are all writing on the same code, meaning they cannot possibly account for every single thing that could go wrong. Consider that your average major title, like GTA, Skyrim, etc, can be hundreds of thousands, if not _millions_ of lines of code. It's easy for something to go wrong.

A suppressor (also known as a silencer) slows the expansion of the gas outside of the barrel.

ELI5,Why are polar bears and grizzly bears considered different species if they can interbreed and produce fertile offspring?,7ndrvj,ds14dx0,"It's very difficult to group living, evolving organisms into discrete categories.

Polar bears diverged from the rest of the *Ursus* genus very recently, therefore they are still genetically similar enough to other bears to produce fertile offspring.

Taxonomy is also based on physical appearance. Since polar bears are  quite distinct from other species of bears in terms of their physical appearance and geographical habitat, the decision was made to consider them a separate species.

Doves and pigeons are another example. There are 310 species of birds within the *Columbiformes* order (which encompasses all pigeon and dove families), many of which are capable of breeding with other species and producing fertile offspring. Their classification as separate species lies mainly in their physical differences.

The long and the short of it is that taxonomy is a human construct, and not everything fits nice and neatly between the lines all of the time.

**Tl;dr:** while this typically isn't the case, there is no hard, taxonomic rule stating that members of different species cannot produce fertile offspring. A better way of thinking about it would be: ""if two populations are unable to interbreed, they cannot be considered the same species"". This doesn't necessarily preclude two species from being able to interbreed.","[""It's very difficult to group living, evolving organisms into discrete categories.\n""

Web-GPT,Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?,2gbxv3,Human demonstration,"While both are forms of entertainment and sometimes relaxation, the experience of binging TV is very different from watching a movie. A TV show stimulates brain activity, making you alert, and you are likely invested in the story if you are binge watching a show. TV shows often leave hooks at the end of an episode, giving the viewer a reason to continue onto the next episode. This means that even after an episode's climax, there will be another component of the plot to keep you stimulated.

Movies, on the other hand, can be exhausting even before you press play. Once you have found a TV show you like, you can try it out and switch to a new show if you're unsatisfied after one episode, but movies involve a longer time commitment.

ELI5,"There is no archeological evidence that dragons ever existed. So, if they're simply imagined, how is it that they're present in almost every major culture and depicted so similarly?",344kc6,cqr7o30,"There are certain things that are common in human mythology, and one of them is that humans are predisposed to be impressed by really big things. And it's easier to imagine a really big version of something that already exists than to design something completely from scratch. Hence why so many cultures have stories of giant humans running around. This applies to other creatures as well; take a reptile of some sort, scale it up to being bigger than a house, and suddenly you've got a dragon of some kind. Imagination adds other embellishments such as horns or breathing fire, or whatever the local variation is. (And they can be pretty varied; consider the differences between a standard European dragon, a Chinese dragon, and the Aztec winged serpent -- but they're all basically big lizards.) Similarly, many cultures have stories of giant birds, be it the ~~European~~ Middle Eastern (thanks productusmaximus!) Roc or the North American Thunderbird.

This of course gives rise to the question of why some animals don't seem to get the gargantuan myth treatment as often.

 Other people don't like this because they feel they are taking jobs that British people could have done instead, leading to greater unemployment.  There are many more non-English speakers than there used to be, and there are lots of shops around catering to various immigrant groups.  Some people don't like this because they think these immigrants will take advantage of the benefit system and not contribute to society. One thing people haven't mentioned is immigration. Despite claims otherwise, immigration was one of the main reasons for the UK voting to leave the EU.

ELI5,Why are there so many fire doors that aren't allowed for regular use?,1mkko5,cca4d3n,"Limiting access to emergency stairwells should ensure that they are in the proper condition to be used in an emergency.

There is often a concern in places like a university or a hospital that people will congregate in stairwells. Either to do something they are not supposed to do, or for whatever reason people seem to love stairs. Seldom used stairwells can become a prime place for storing old furniture or other equipment that makes evacuation hazardous when there is a real emergency. 

Additionally, many emergency fire doors lead to parts of a building that are not designed for regular access. (I am looking at a fire door that leads to a creepy underground tunnel which terminates in an alley two blocks from the building. I would not want random people walking through that door thinking they are going directly out to the street and then getting lost in the emergency egress tunnel.)

Underlying your question is another question, why do buildings need so many otherwise useless fire exits? 

Large institutional fires are horrific, and the death toll often results from lack of access to means of egress. If you have a fire in your building, you want as few wrongful death lawsuits as possible, the easiest way to save people (other than not having any fires, which is attempted though less obvious then fire doors), is having lots of visible means of safe exit. 

Lastly, the more I see a fire exit that I can't use, the more I think about it and hopefully in a fire I would rush towards that fire door that I never use but always think about rather then the overflowing regular exit.","['Limiting access to emergency stairwells should ensure that they are in the proper condition to be used in an emergency.'

There is often a concern in places like a university or a hospital that people will congregate in stairwells. Either to do something they are not supposed to do, or for whatever reason people seem to love stairs. Seldom used stairwells can become a prime place for storing old furniture or other equipment that makes evacuation hazardous when there is a real emergency. 

Additionally, many emergency fire doors lead to parts of a building that are not designed for regular access. (I am looking at a fire door that leads to a creepy underground tunnel which terminates in an alley two blocks from the building. I would not want random people walking through that door thinking they are going directly out to the street and then getting lost in the emergency egress tunnel.)

Underlying your question is another question, why do buildings need so many otherwise useless fire exits? 

Large institutional fires are horrific, and the death toll often results from lack of access to means of egress. If you have a fire in your building, you want as few wrongful death lawsuits as possible, the easiest way to save people (other than not having any fires, which is attempted though less obvious then fire doors), is having lots of visible means of safe exit. 

Lastly, the more I see a fire exit that I can't use, the more I think about it and hopefully in a fire I would rush towards that fire door that I never use but always think about rather then the overflowing regular exit.","[1, 2, 0]","[7, 10, 9]"

ELI5,Why has Walmart struggled overseas when it was able to completely dominate the United States market?,4b3m9a,d15s4zs,"I live in Germany, where Walmart spectacularly failed. The biggest issue seems to be that Walmart failed to understand how cultural differences come into play; among the problems that are blamed for Walmart's failure in Germany are:

* overambitious expansionist plans that went ahead despite the fact that a German company had successfully fought off a hostile takeover bid, at a time when Walmart was still very small in Germany;
* attempts to cut costs by threatening workers with redundancy if they didn't accept working practices that were borderline illegal in Germany;
* being forced by a German court to comply with German law by publishing financial statements, which revealed that the company was far worse off than it had claimed;
* annoying employees and customers alike by insisting on policies that work well in the US but which Germans find creepy, such as employing greeters, or making staff offer assistance to any customer that comes within range (Germans prefer to be left to shop on their own, and to approach staff if and when they need help).

The mistake was to fail to understand that laws, expectations and cultural attitudes are very different in other countries, and that not complying with them can sink your business.

NQ,why are my eyes always red in photos,5011051341742964036,1," In flash photography the light of the flash occurs too fast for the pupil to close , so much of the very bright light from the flash passes into the eye through the pupil , reflects off the fundus at the back of the eyeball and out through the pupil . The camera records this reflected light . The main cause of the red color is the ample amount of blood in the choroid which nourishes the back of the eye and is located behind the retina . The blood in the retinal circulation is far less than in the choroid , and plays virtually no role . The eye contains several photostable pigments that all absorb in the short wavelength region , and hence contribute somewhat to the red eye effect . The lens cuts off deep blue and violet light , below 430 nm ( depending on age ) , and macular pigment absorbs between 400 and 500 nm , but this pigment is located exclusively in the tiny fovea . Melanin , located in the retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) and the choroid , shows a gradually increasing absorption towards the short wavelengths . But blood is the main determinant of the red color , because it is completely transparent at long wavelengths and abruptly starts absorbing at 600 nm . The amount of red light emerging from the pupil depends on the amount of melanin in the layers behind the retina . This amount varies strongly between individuals . Light skinned people with blue eyes have relatively low melanin in the fundus and thus show a much stronger red - eye effect than dark skinned people with brown eyes . The same holds for animals . The color of the iris itself is of virtually no importance for the red - eye effect . This is obvious because the red - eye effect is most apparent when photographing dark adapted subjects , hence with fully dilated pupils . Photographs taken with infrared light through night vision devices always show very bright pupils because , in the dark , the pupils are fully dilated and the infrared light is not absorbed by any ocular pigment .

Web-GPT,how are different types of cheese made?,376vh6,Human demonstration,"Differences among types of cheese can generally be attributed to the origin of the milk used, the type(s) of molds and bacteria added, and the length(s) of ageing. 
Most cheese is made from cow's milk, but milk from other animals, particularly goats and sheep, is also used. The composition of milk can depend on the type and breed of animal, the season and geographic location, and the health and nutrition of the animal. 
Additionally, different molds or bacteria are added depending on whether the cheese is soft ripened or hard. Soft ripened cheeses such as Camembert and Brie have a mold added to the surface. This mold produces a protein-digesting enzyme that breaks down the curd during ripening, creating a runny texture. Harder cheeses can be made using either mesophilic starter bacteria or thermophilic starter bacteria. Swiss cheese varieties made using thermophilic starter bacteria can withstand higher processing temperatures, and the subsequent bacterial growth creates the characteristic gas hole or ""eyes."" Hard cheeses may also be cut more finely and pressed longer and harder during processing to release more moisture.
Finally, differences in the ageing or ripening process lead to differences in moisture and flavor. Some cheeses may be aged for only several days, while others may be aged up to 2 years. As the ageing period increases, the cheese loses more moisture, develops a stronger flavor and becomes harder and more crumbly in texture.","['Differences among types of cheese can generally be attributed to the origin of the milk used, the type(s) of molds and bacteria added, and the length(s) of ageing.'

Left turns also mean turning against the flow of traffic, which increases the risk of an accident with another car, and they are also more likely to cause a deadly accident with a pedestrian. Taking right turns conserves fuel, decreases driving time, and avoids risks and delays, saving the UPS millions of gallons of gas each year.","[""The UPS's policy of avoiding left turns has saved the company fuel by making routes faster and safer.""

ELI5,"Is vaping unhealthy? Ive read different articles, some that says it might be bad, and some that says its harmless.",6zyeor,dmz13w6,"The issue with vaping is that it is a relatively new way to use nicotine. It took decades of research and observation to identify the adverse health effects to chronic users of other tobacco products, and it will likely take a similar amount of time to confidently identify any problems that arise with e-cigarette use. That said, e-cigarettes do not contain the same harmful ingredients as cigarettes, which probably makes them safer, although I can't say how much.

There have been some studies that show using e-cigarettes increases your risk of developing respiratory symptoms such as coughing or increased phlegm production. It is possible that it could increase your risk for heart disease, although that risk seems to be hypothetical at the moment.

As far as cancer goes, while many of the carcinogens found in cigarettes are much lower in e-cigarettes, propylene glycol and glycerol (the main components in the liquid cartridge) both break down into several potential carcinogens. I can't say whether this makes lung cancer/disease more or less likely, however.

And of course, nicotine abuse is bad for your cardiovascular system. That has not changed.

TLDR; it's up in the air. The general consensus seems to be it is likely safer than cigarettes, however it's possible that there could be some bad stuff in the vapor. If there are negative health consequences, we won't really find out until people start getting sick, unfortunately.","['The issue with vaping is that it is a relatively new way to use nicotine.'

ELI5,Why do dams have a massive ramp when releasing overflow water?,521lvl,d7gnhu2,"Spillways are generally used in emergency situations when you need to reduce the water level in your reservoir FAST. The water released has huge amounts of energy, as you can see in the video.

Think of all the damage that water can do when it reaches the bottom. If you just had a ramp straight down, the water would reach the downstream riverbed with huge amounts of energy, and start pushing away the soil and rocks at the bottom (causing erosion). 

But, so what if that stuff gets pushed away? Well the dam is a really heavy structure that's supporting lots of pressure, and so it requires a good base to stand on. If this erosion goes uncontrolled, the dam can become unsupported and lose stability, leading to a collapse. This would be catastrophic for anyone/anything that is downstream. (You can google dam collapses, that shit ain't pretty).

With this in mind, spillways are designed with a big curve at the bottom called a 'ski jump'. The purpose is simple: to dissipate all of that energy flowing downstream. And tbh it also has the added benefit of looking super cool.","['Spillways are generally used in emergency situations when you need to reduce the water level in your reservoir FAST.'

ELI5,"What happens if I inject a needle(medicine, drugs, etc) into myself and it isn't into a vein? For example into my palm, or in a random place on my arm.",3wunwb,cxzimz9,"MD here. Lots of medications are meant to be injected either under the skin into the fatty tissue (subcutaneous/SC) or into muscle tissue (intramuscular/IM). For example, insulin and some blood thinners are injected SC, while most vaccines are given IM. A lot of medications can be given either intravenously (IV) or IM or SC. The main difference with the SC/IM routes is that the drug will be absorbed into the bloodstream more slowly, which may be preferable in certain situations. However, other medications can be disastrous if they leak out of a vein (""extravasate""). These are often highly concentrated, hyperosmolar solutions such as hypertonic saline, calcium chloride, or the IV contrast used for CT scans. The result is often necrosis (death) of the affected tissue, pain, swelling, and compartment syndrome, which can cut off blood supply to the affected extremity and lead to amputations. When it comes to recreational drugs like heroin, the intensity of the ""high"" is relative to how fast the drug gets into the brain. Injecting into a vein, therefore, is going to deliver the drug to the brain in a high concentration within seconds, with the resulting ""rush"" that IV heroin users are chasing. If you miss the vein, the heroin is probably going IM or SC, so it will get into the bloodstream, and the brain, more slowly, with a less intense high. A lot of long-time heroin users have scarred up their veins so much that they have to resort to ""skin popping"", which is basically SC or sometimes a more superficial ""intradermal"" injection. This often leads to awful skin and soft tissue infections and abscesses. All those nasty pictures you've seen floating around Reddit of ""krokodil"" users and their horrid necrotizing skin infections are the result of chronic skin popping and IM drug injection.","['MD here.'

So when you walk into a different environment, and your mind has strayed slightly from what your doing, it's easy to completely forget as your brain doesn't match the environment with the thought you had in the previous place. It's basically that you take a mental image of your surroundings when you have a thought, about anything, and you associate the two with each other. It's why people walk back into the room they had the thought and often remember what it is they were thinking of.

Data is sent over the internet in two types of packets: TCP packets, which have information about their data content in their headers that make them easier for a firewall to filter, and UDP packets, which have port information but no header information to assist the filter. The firewall inspects the packets and compares the content to the computer's data rule configuration so it only lets through what is approved. The three kinds of firewalls are stateless (or packet filtering) firewalls, stateful firewalls, and application firewalls.
