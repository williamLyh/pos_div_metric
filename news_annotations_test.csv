0,Vietnam sets higher target on catfish export earnings in 2019,"Vietnam has set a target of reaping some 2.4 billion U.S. dollars from exporting tra fish or shark catfish, a common kind of catfish, this year, posting a year-on-year rise of around 9 percent. Vietnam made a total tra fish output of 1.4 million tons in 2018, up 20 percent against 2017, part of which were exported, fetching over 2.2 billion U.S. dollars, up 26.4 percent, according to the Vietnam Tra Fish Association on Thursday. Specifically, Vietnam gained 549.4 million U.S. dollars from exporting tra fish to the United States last year, up 59.5 percent, and 243.9 million U.S. dollars from shipping the fish to the European Union, up 20.2 percent. Vietnam's Mekong Delta is striving to regulate tra fish output and improving quality of the fish, partly by preventing unauthorized aquaculture and strictly monitoring the use of chemicals like antibiotics in farming, the association said.","Vietnam has set a target of reaping some 2.4 billion U.S. dollars from exporting tra fish or shark catfish, a common kind of catfish, this year, posting a year-on-year rise of around 9 percent.

1,Egypt police kill 4 terrorists involved in car bomb attack,"The security forces also arrested two Hasm members during relevant raids, according to Thursday's statement. Terror activities in Egypt have killed hundreds of policemen, soldiers and civilians since the military toppled Morsi in July 2013 in response to mass protests against his one-year rule and his Brotherhood group. The Sinai-based branch of the Islamic State (IS) regional terrorist group claimed responsibility for most of the terror operations in Egypt over the past few years. The police refers to Hasm group as the armed wing of the currently outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group of former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi. Meanwhile, the Egyptian forces killed hundreds of terrorists and arrested thousands of suspects during the country's anti-terror war declared by President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the army chief then, following Morsi's ouster. A day after the blast, which failed to harm Alexandria security chief, the police announced killing six of Hasm group militants and said they were involved in the terror operation. Hasm appeared in late 2016 and claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks that killed policemen in the country. The Egyptian police killed four terrorists of the so-called Hasm group in a shootout during a raid on their hiding place in Upper Egypt's province of Assiut, the Egyptian Interior Ministry said in a statement Thursday. The police said the four were involved in a car bomb attack on March 24 in the northern province of Alexandria that killed two policemen and wounded at least four others.","The police said the four were involved in a car bomb attack on March 24 in the northern province of Alexandria that killed two policemen and wounded at least four others.

2,Ban on All Political Gifts Is Included in Ethics Reform Proposals by New Jersey Senate Leader,"Mr. Codey said the measures, which he hoped would pass by the end of the legislative session on July 1, would bolster public confidence in elected officials in a state that has seen more than 200 federal corruption convictions in the past five years. The Senate president, Richard J. Codey, said he also planned to introduce measures that would ban political contributions by public entities, step up ethics training for lawmakers and their aides and provide full disclosure for expenditures that are added to the state's budget at the last minute. ""There are certain things we can do,"" he said in a telephone interview. The president of the New Jersey State Senate on Thursday proposed a ban on all gifts to lawmakers as part of a sweeping package of bills intended to stiffen penalties for ethics violations. Mr. Codey said he did not expect resistance to the measures, largely because each of the 120 seats in the State Legislature is up for election in November and lawmakers will be reluctant to appear soft on public corruption in a state weary of scandal. Of the seven bills proposed by Mr. Codey on Thursday, the two most significant concern the acceptance of gifts by lawmakers and increased transparency in the state's budget process. ""We've got to make sure that we're up to speed on these progressive measures."" Several lawmakers called for such a measure last year when more than a quarter billion dollars in expenditures for pet projects were added to the $31 billion budget only hours before it was voted on. Currently, legislators and their staff members are allowed to accept gifts valued up to $250. Mr. Codey said his proposal for advance notification about 11th-hour budget additions would require lawmakers to submit a written request for changes to the governor's proposed budget 10 to 14 days before the Legislature considers the budget bill. Mr. Codey is seeking a complete prohibition on gifts. Jon S. Corzine cut more than $51 million of those last-minute additions. Before approving the budget, which ended a seven-day shutdown of state government, Gov. ""Senate President Codey should certainly be commended,"" Mr. Corzine's spokesman, Anthony Coley, said on Thursday. Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr. also pledged his support and said he hoped the measures would ""help dispel some of the public's skepticism and cynicism about government."" Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, the leader of the Republican minority in the Assembly, said many of the proposals mirrored ideas already submitted by Republicans in recent months. ""He has a partner in Governor Corzine on this."" ""I hope Senate President Codey will also consider these ideas,"" Mr. DeCroce said.","The president of the New Jersey State Senate on Thursday proposed a ban on all gifts to lawmakers as part of a sweeping package of bills intended to stiffen penalties for ethics violations.

3,CONTINENTAL AIRLINES BOARD DISCUSSES MERGER WITH UNITED XXXXXXXX: JUMP HEADLINE GOES HEREY AND HEREY,"Continental Airlines board of directors met Wednesday to discuss a merger with United Airlines, a person familiar with the situation said. That meeting likely indicates the two airlines are making progress in their talks, which earlier this week were reportedly bogged down over price issues related to an all-stock transaction. Another Continental board meeting is likely in the next several days. Speculation in and around the industry is increasing that the two airlines will, in fact, get a deal done. And that it could come as soon as this weekend. ""It clearly indicates they are in pretty advanced stages,"" said Hunter Keay, an airline analyst with Stifel Nicolaus said of word that Continental's board had met. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we have an announcement relatively soon. There's going to be some long nights this weekend without a doubt."" Some details have already emerged, including that Continental's CEO, Chairman and President Jeff Smisek would serve as the CEO of a merged carrier and that United's CEO, Chairman and President Glenn Tilton would be non-executive chairman. The merged carrier - to be called United - would be based in Chicago. Neither airline has publicly confirmed the merger talks. Spokeswoman at both airlines declined comment again Wednesday. Continental and United held merger talks in 2008 but Continental ended them. Continental and United restarted merger discussions earlier this month after United again courted Tempe, Ariz.-based US Airways. Last week, the negotiations with US Airways were called off. If United and Continental marry, the new airline will be the nation's largest carrier, eclipsing Delta Air Lines, which merged with Northwest Airlines in 2008. Continental's shares closed up 55 cents at $22.17 Wednesday and United's closed up $1.24 to $21.75. An airline industry expert said airline officials want to make a decision about whether to merge as soon as possible. ""Uncertainty is nobody's friend. You want to get this resolved as quickly as you can. Your whole organization is in limbo ,which is not good for anybody,"" said the industry observer. Meanwhile, local city and business leaders are continuing to reach out to Continental and United to make the case to locate the merged company's headquarters in Houston. The Greater Houston Partnership and mayor have reached out - through letters and calls - to both airlines bosses. And they've received no response yet, they said during an editorial board meeting Wednesday at the Houston Chronicle. ""Our concern is we remain the headquarters for a lot reasons beyond simply what might in effect be a few hundred jobs going one way or another,"" Mayor Annise Parker said. ""We believe in the long run it's better for the airport. It's better for the city of Houston, and what we've had is a number of one way conversations."" Parker said she hopes the operational headquarters remain in Houston, even if the paper headquarters moves to Chicago. ""That's where the power is,"" she said, adding that if Continental's management team leads the merged airline, it would make sense to keep the headquarters in Houston.","""Uncertainty is nobody's friend.

4,PROSECUTORS RAID HOME OF FORMER SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT,"At the time, Chun claimed to have less than $260 in his bank accounts, although opposition lawmakers alleged that he may have had huge assets stashed away. There was no immediate comment from Chun Doo-hwan’s family about the raids Tuesday. The investigators also searched the properties owned by his eldest son, Chun Jae-kook. Under the old law, prosecutors had only until October. Last month, the National Assembly passed a bill extending the statute of limitations on confiscating assets from public officials who have failed to pay fines. He initially was sentenced to death, a penalty that was reduced to a life imprisonment. In the 1997 verdict, he was also convicted of sedition for his role in the 1979 military coup that brought him to power and a 1980 military crackdown that left hundreds of people dead in the southwestern city of Kwangju. Lewis and Roald Dahl. The son’s publishing company, Sigongsa Inc., is one of the country’s largest and has published the Korean translations of books by John Grisham, C.?S. Chun has been dogged by prosecutors for years. Television footage showed them hauling away paintings, porcelain and expensive artifacts. The military coup in 1979 propelled Chun, an army major general at the time, into the power vacuum created by the assassination of President Park Chung-hee, the father of the current president, Park Geun-hye. Suspicion resurfaced after Newstapa, a website run by the Korea Center of Investigative Journalism, recently reported that Chun Jae-kook set up a shell company in the British Virgin Islands in 2004. Roh has more than 90 percent of the sum. In 2000, they seized a Mercedes-Benz sedan from him. She said she would repay the money to the state. In a Supreme Court ruling in 1997, Chun, now 82, was ordered to return to the state 220 billion won he illegally accumulated through bribery from big businesses during his eight and a half years in power in the 1980s. Another son, Chun Jae-man, and his father-in-law run a California winery. He has so far paid only a quarter of the amount. In 2003, they confiscated a refrigerator, television set and golf clubs and auctioned them off. Former President Roh Tae-woo, a fellow army general and friend of Chun who replaced him as president, was also ordered to pay back 260 billion won. Chun has rarely appeared in public since he stepped down in 1988 and entered a Buddhist monastery. During her presidential campaign, Park admitted that she had received 600 million won from Chun after the coup. He was later pardoned and freed. On Tuesday, a team of 90 prosecutors, tax collectors and other investigators ransacked Chun’s home in eastern Seoul. The new law extended the statute of limitations on Chun Doo-hwan’s case until 2020 and allowed prosecutors to collect from his family members as well if they could prove that any of their properties originated from Chun’s illegal funds. SEOUL, South Korea - State prosecutors armed with metal detectors raided the Seoul residence of former President Chun Doo-hwan on Tuesday to look for assets of the ex-military dictator who owes South Korea 167.5 billion won ($150 million) in fines but claims to be broke. In his last payment, he handed in 3 million won he said he collected as a lecture fee.

After leaving the U.S. and renouncing his citizenship, Rich sold many of his domestic business interests, including 20th Century Fox to Rupert Murdoch for $250 million in 1984. Despite his notoriety, Rich, whose net worth was estimated at $2.5 billion, continued to work in the commodities industry, and founded Marc Rich & Co., the precursor of Glencore International, the commodities trader, which he later sold to the company’s management team in 1993. The pardon brought the oil trader back into the headlines after it was revealed that Rich’s former wife, Denise Eisenberg, had given donations to the Democratic Party in 2000, according to official records. “They respected the contracts,” Rich told Daniel Ammann, a Swiss journalist, in 2009, in reference to Iran’s national oil company. From 1973, Rich was similarly one of Israel’s most important oil suppliers for more than 20 years, and he held Israeli, Spanish and Belgian citizenship by the end of his life. He was a friend and one of the great pioneers of the commodities trading industry,” Glencore-Xstrata’s current chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, said in a statement. “We performed a service for them. Over the years, Rich claimed that U.S. authorities had attempted several times to bring him to justice, including a plan, which was never carried out, to use a helicopter in Switzerland to capture him, according to a book published by Ammann in 2009. He was 78. His clients also included the apartheid regime of South Africa and the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. “Our deepest sympathies and condolences are with his family at this time.” They couldn’t do it themselves, so we were able to do it.” The cause was a brain stroke at a hospital, according to a statement from his spokesman. All told, the offenses would have led to more than 300 years in prison. He is expected to be buried in Israel on Thursday. After being one of the country’s most famous fugitives for the next two decades, Rich eventually received a pardon from President Bill Clinton on his last day in office in early 2001. “We are saddened to hear of the death of Marc. Rich was born in Antwerp, Belgium, but moved to New York with his family to escape the rise of the Nazis in Germany. He began his career as a metals trader in the early 1970s, and gained prominence during the 1973-74 oil crisis when he circumvented the Arab oil embargo to sell oil to U.S. companies in desperate need of supplies at increasingly high prices.

Rich courted controversy throughout his colorful career, and was indicted by the U.S. in the early 1980s on charges of tax evasion and illegally trading with Iran. Glencore, the commodities company he founded, recently acquired the mining company Xstrata for around $30 billion, and has become a global giant in a number of commodities, including oil, iron ore and coal.","Marc Rich, the former fugitive oil trader and founder of the commodities trading giant Glencore International, died on Wednesday in Lucerne, Switzerland.

8,"'Brothers and sisters' of the Mafia, repent, pope says in Sicily","LIKE A RELIGIOUS CULT Convert yourselves to the real God, Jesus Christ, dear brothers and sisters,” he said in his dockside sermon. Cardinal Ernesto Ruffini, who was archbishop of Palermo from 1945-1967, denied the Mafia’s existence, considering communism the Church’s biggest threat. In 2012, former Pope Benedict decreed that Puglisi died as a martyr in “hatred of the faith,” and ordered that he be beatified, the last step before sainthood in the Church. Puglisi refused to play along. “A person who is a Mafioso does not live as a Christian because with his life he blasphemes against the name of God,” Francis said in the sermon of a Mass from some 80,000 people in the port area of the Sicilian capital. Magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino were killed in twin bomb attacks in Palermo in 1992. “I say to Mafiosi: Change, brothers and sisters! Later, on his way to the airport, Francis made an unscheduled stop to pray and lay flowers at the spot on the highway where Falcone, his wife and three police agents were blown up as their motorcade passed on May 23, 1992. Puglisi’s murder was ordered by local bosses Filippo and Giuseppe Graviano. Stop thinking about yourselves and your money ... Particularly in smaller towns and cities in the south, they take part in Catholic sacraments and in some cases have also found complicity by some churchmen. Francis, in the Sicilian capital, said organized crime members - many of whom go to church and worship openly - “cannot believe in God and be Mafiosi” at the same time. “Today, we need men and women of love, not men and women of honor; men and women of service, not of oppression.” All but one received life sentences. “I say to you, Mafiosi, if you don’t do this, your very life will be lost and that will be your greatest defeat,” he said. In his appeal, he referred to them as “dear brothers and sisters”. Many members of organized crime groups in Italy, such as Sicily’s Cosa Nostra and Calabria’s Ndrangheta, see themselves as part of a religious, cult-like group, invoking the help of saints for their activities. One of the killers, who later turned state’s evidence, said that as Puglisi was dying he said: “I’ve been expecting you”. Puglisi was killed on his 56th birthday during a bloody Mafia offensive against the state and anyone else who threatened the group’s existence. He helped young people in an area with high unemployment avoid the snare of the Mafia, asked parishioners to help police investigations, refused donations from mobsters and banned them from joining traditional religious street processions. The crowd interrupted his sermon with applause each time he denounced the Mafia. The Catholic Church in southern Italy has had a checkered history of relations with the mob. The bothers and four men who planned or carried out the killing were convicted in 1998. Pope Francis appealed to Sicily’s Mafia on Saturday to abandon a life of crime and violence, saying the island needed “men and women of love, not men and women ‘of honor,’” using the term mobsters apply to themselves. He visited Palermo to commemorate Father Giuseppe “Pino” Puglisi, a priest shot dead by Mafia hit men in 1993 because he challenged the organization’s control over one of the city’s toughest neighborhoods. With little support by the Church hierarchy in Sicily, he preached against the Mafia from the pulpit of his church in the rough Brancaccio neighborhood, then controlled by the Graviano family.","Pope Francis appealed to Sicily’s Mafia on Saturday to abandon a life of crime and violence, saying the island needed “men and women of love, not men and women ‘of honor,’” using the term mobsters apply to themselves.

9,LAW FIRMS ORRICK AND PILLSBURY IN MERGER TALKS,"The law firms Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman are in advanced merger talks, with an announcement of a deal expected as early as next week. A combination would create one of the country’s 10 largest firms with about 1,700 lawyers. The discussions underscore the pressure on corporate law firms to grow their businesses amid persistently soft demand for legal services and the increasing globalization of the corporate law industry. “Our firms are in exploratory discussions about a possible combination,” James Rishwain, the chairman of Pillsbury, and Mitch Zuklie, the chairman of Orrick, said in a joint statement. “These talks are serving to confirm the great respect our firms have for each other.” People close to the talks said that the deal could still fall apart but that they were far along. Typically, the executive committees of each firm agree to the main terms of a merger and then the entire partnerships vote at a later date. The news was first reported by Reuters. Mergers among the nation’s 100 largest firms once occurred infrequently, and marriages involving top firms were rarer still. But today, firms are under pressure to add to their practices quickly to break into new geographic markets and practice areas. And some legal industry studies have concluded that size matters in corporate law - the larger the firm, the stronger the brand. Law firm mergers are booming, and a combination of Orrick and Pillsbury would be the year’s largest. Fifty-eight law firms had announced mergers as of the end of September, a 41 percent increase from the same period last year, according to survey by Altman Weil, a legal industry consulting firm. In 2012, the large Houston firm, Fulbright & Jaworksi, joined forces with Norton Rose in Britain, creating a firm of nearly 4,000 lawyers. Dentons, a firm of about 2,500 lawyers, is in talks to acquire McKenna Long & Aldridge in a deal that would push its lawyer count to more than 3,000. But law firm mergers carry significant risk. For starters, there is a possibility that the leaking of merger talks can have a destabilizing effect on the firms involved, leading to defections by important partners who may disapprove of a deal or fear a lesser role - or less compensation - at the combined firm. Big law firm deals have a mixed track record and often result in power struggles and cultural clashes. Most infamously, the 2007 merger of Dewey Ballantine and LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & MacRae - the largest merger of New York law firms in history - was a fiasco. Last year, the combined firm, Dewey & LeBoeuf, collapsed in bankruptcy amid financial mismanagement and partner defections. In 2006, Orrick had flirted with possible disaster when it had agreed to the main terms of a combination with Dewey Ballantine, but the deal fell apart after several top partners jumped ship when merger talks were leaked. Orrick, with 1,100 lawyers, has talked with several firms over the past decade but never made it to the altar. Pillsbury, too, recently discussed a deal with Fulbright. Although today each has offices across the globe, both Orrick’s and Pillsbury’s historical roots are firmly grounded on the West Coast. Each was started in San Francisco in the 1860s in the wake of the California gold rush. A merger would create a formidable presence in Silicon Valley, which has become an area of expansion for corporate firms. In Washington, Pillsbury has an especially strong nuclear energy practice, another hot practice area.","For starters, there is a possibility that the leaking of merger talks can have a destabilizing effect on the firms involved, leading to defections by important partners who may disapprove of a deal or fear a lesser role - or less compensation - at the combined firm.

Fifty-eight law firms had announced mergers as of the end of September, a 41 percent increase from the same period last year, according to survey by Altman Weil, a legal industry consulting firm. In 2012, the large Houston firm, Fulbright & Jaworksi, joined forces with Norton Rose in Britain, creating a firm of nearly 4,000 lawyers. Law firm mergers are booming, and a combination of Orrick and Pillsbury would be the year’s largest. But law firm mergers carry significant risk. Big law firm deals have a mixed track record and often result in power struggles and cultural clashes. Most infamously, the 2007 merger of Dewey Ballantine and LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & MacRae - the largest merger of New York law firms in history - was a fiasco. Last year, the combined firm, Dewey & LeBoeuf, collapsed in bankruptcy amid financial mismanagement and partner defections. In 2006, Orrick had flirted with possible disaster when it had agreed to the main terms of a combination with Dewey Ballantine, but the deal fell apart after several top partners jumped ship when merger talks were leaked. For starters, there is a possibility that the leaking of merger talks can have a destabilizing effect on the firms involved, leading to defections by important partners who may disapprove of a deal or fear a lesser role - or less compensation - at the combined firm. In Washington, Pillsbury has an especially strong nuclear energy practice, another hot practice area. Each was started in San Francisco in the 1860s in the wake of the California gold rush. Although today each has offices across the globe, both Orrick’s and Pillsbury’s historical roots are firmly grounded on the West Coast. Orrick, with 1,100 lawyers, has talked with several firms over the past decade but never made it to the altar. A merger would create a formidable presence in Silicon Valley, which has become an area of expansion for corporate firms. Pillsbury, too, recently discussed a deal with Fulbright.",[1 2 0]
